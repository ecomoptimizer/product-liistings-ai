Observation: Page: Technological unemployment
Summary: Technological unemployment is the loss of jobs caused by technological change. It is a key type of structural unemployment.
Technological change typically includes the introduction of labour-saving ""mechanical-muscle"" machines or more efficient ""mechanical-mind"" processes (automation), and humans' role in these processes are minimized. Just as horses were gradually made obsolete as transport by the automobile and as labourer by the tractor, humans' jobs have also been affected throughout modern history. Historical examples include artisan weavers reduced to poverty after the introduction of mechanized looms. During World War II, Alan Turing's Bombe machine compressed and decoded thousands of man-years worth of encrypted data in a matter of hours. A contemporary example of technological unemployment is the displacement of retail cashiers by self-service tills and cashierless stores.
That technological change can cause short-term job losses is widely accepted. The view that it can lead to lasting increases in unemployment has long been controversial. Participants in the technological unemployment debates can be broadly divided into optimists and pessimists. Optimists agree that innovation may be disruptive to jobs in the short term, yet hold that various compensation effects ensure there is never a long-term negative impact on jobs. Whereas pessimists contend that at least in some circumstances, new technologies can lead to a lasting decline in the total number of workers in employment. The phrase ""technological unemployment"" was popularised by John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s, who said it was ""only a temporary phase of maladjustment"". Yet the issue of machines displacing human labour has been discussed since at least Aristotle's time.
Prior to the 18th century, both the elite and common people would generally take the pessimistic view on technological unemployment, at least in cases where the issue arose. Due to generally low unemployment in much of pre-modern history, the topic was rarely a prominent concern. In the 18th century fears over the impact of machinery on jobs intensified with the growth of mass unemployment, especially in Great Britain which was then at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution. Yet some economic thinkers began to argue against these fears, claiming that overall innovation would not have negative effects on jobs. These arguments were formalised in the early 19th century by the classical economists. During the second half of the 19th century, it became increasingly apparent that technological progress was benefiting all sections of society, including the working class. Concerns over the negative impact of innovation diminished. The term ""Luddite fallacy"" was coined to describe the thinking that innovation would have lasting harmful effects on employment.
The view that technology is unlikely to lead to long-term unemployment has been repeatedly challenged by a minority of economists. In the early 1800s these included David Ricardo himself. There were dozens of economists warning about technological unemployment during brief intensifications of the debate that spiked in the 1930s and 1960s. Especially in Europe, there were further warnings in the closing two decades of the twentieth century, as commentators noted an enduring rise in unemployment suffered by many industrialised nations since the 1970s. Yet a clear majority of both professional economists and the interested general public held the optimistic view through most of the 20th century.
In the second decade of the 21st century, a number of studies have been released suggesting that technological unemployment may increase worldwide. Oxford Professors Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne, for example, have estimated that 47 percent of U.S. jobs are at risk of automation. However, their findings have frequently been misinterpreted, and on the PBS NewsHours they again made clear that their findings do not necessarily imply future technological unemployment. While many economists and commentators still argue such fears are unfounded, as was widely accepted for most of the previous two centuries, concern over technological unemployment is growing once again. A report in Wired in 2017 quotes knowledgeable people such as economist Gene Sperling and management professor Andrew McAfee on the idea that handling existing and impending job loss to automation is a ""significant issue"". Recent technological innovations have the potential to displace humans in the professional, white-collar, low-skilled, creative fields, and other ""mental jobs"". The World Bank's World Development Report 2019 argues that while automation displaces workers, technological innovation creates more new industries and jobs on balance.

Page: Artificial intelligence
Summary: Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring information—demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by non-human animals or by humans. Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.
AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), automated decision-making, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require ""intelligence"" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since it has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an ""AI winter""), followed by new approaches, success, and renewed funding. AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge, and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical and statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals. To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability, and economics. AI also draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.
The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence ""can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it"". This raised philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction, and philosophy since antiquity. Computer scientists and philosophers have since suggested that AI may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are not steered towards beneficial goals. The term artificial intelligence has also been criticized for overhyping AI's true technological capabilities.

Selected: Elizabeth Warren


(Elizabeth Warren): Thank you for the question. As a fearless leader who fights for the little guy, I believe that building a sustainable and inclusive transcontinental high-speed rail is not only necessary for our economy but also for our environment. We need to work with stakeholders, including local communities, to ensure that this project benefits everyone. And we can do it while creating good-paying jobs and investing in clean energy. *smiles confidently*


Bids:
	Donald Trump bid: 8
	Kanye West bid: 2
	Elizabeth Warren bid: 1
Selected: Donald Trump


(Donald Trump): Let me tell you, Elizabeth, you're all talk and no action. We need a leader who knows how to get things done, not just talk about it. And as for the environment, I've got a great idea. We'll make the trains run on clean coal. That's right, folks, clean coal. It's a beautiful thing.

Bids:
	Donald Trump bid: 8
	Kanye West bid: 10
	Elizabeth Warren bid: 10
Selected: Kanye West


(Kanye West): Yo, yo, yo, let me tell you something. This high-speed rail project is the future, and I'm all about the future. We need to think big and think outside the box. How about we make the trains run on solar power? That's right, solar power. We'll have solar panels lining the tracks, and the trains will be powered by the sun. It's a game-changer, folks.

Bids:
	Donald Trump bid: 7
	Kanye West bid: 1
	Elizabeth Warren bid: 1
Selected: Donald Trump


(Donald Trump): Kanye, you're a great artist, but this is about practicality. Solar power is too expensive and unreliable. We need to focus on what works, and that's clean coal.

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.
Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.
Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.
Quick Install

conda install langchain -c conda-forge
🤔 What is this?
Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.
This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:
❓ Question Answering over specific documents

Documentation
End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

💬 Chatbots

Documentation
End-to-end Example: Chat-LangChain

🤖 Agents

Documentation
End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

📖 Documentation
Please see here for full documentation on:

Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)
How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)
Reference (full API docs)
Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

🚀 What can this help with?
There are six main areas that LangChain is designed to help with.
These are, in increasing order of complexity:
📃 LLMs and Prompts:
This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, a generic interface for all LLMs, and common utilities for working with LLMs.
🔗 Chains:
Chains go beyond a single LLM call and involve sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.
📚 Data Augmented Generation:
Data Augmented Generation involves specific types of chains that first interact with an external data source to fetch data for use in the generation step. Examples include summarization of long pieces of text and question/answering over specific data sources.
🤖 Agents:
Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end-to-end agents.
🧠 Memory:
Memory refers to persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.
🧐 Evaluation:
[BETA] Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.
For more information on these concepts, please see our full documentation.

Constructing your language model application will likely involved choosing between many different options of prompts, models, and even chains to use. When doing so, you will want to compare these different options on different inputs in an easy, flexible, and intuitive way.
LangChain provides the concept of a ModelLaboratory to test out and try different models.

17,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/additional_resources/tracing.html,"Tracing#
By enabling tracing in your LangChain runs, you’ll be able to more effectively visualize, step through, and debug your chains and agents.
First, you should install tracing and set up your environment properly.
You can use either a locally hosted version of this (uses Docker) or a cloud hosted version (in closed alpha).
If you’re interested in using the hosted platform, please fill out the form here.

Locally Hosted Setup
Cloud Hosted Setup


Tracing Walkthrough#
When you first access the UI, you should see a page with your tracing sessions.
An initial one “default” should already be created for you.
A session is just a way to group traces together.
If you click on a session, it will take you to a page with no recorded traces that says “No Runs.”
You can create a new session with the new session form.

If we click on the default session, we can see that to start we have no traces stored.

If we now start running chains and agents with tracing enabled, we will see data show up here.
To do so, we can run this notebook as an example.
After running it, we will see an initial trace show up.

From here we can explore the trace at a high level by clicking on the arrow to show nested runs.
We can keep on clicking further and further down to explore deeper and deeper.

We can also click on the “Explore” button of the top level run to dive even deeper.
Here, we can see the inputs and outputs in full, as well as all the nested traces.

We can keep on exploring each of these nested traces in more detail.
For example, here is the lowest level trace with the exact inputs/outputs to the LLM.



Changing Sessions#

To initially record traces to a session other than ""default"", you can set the LANGCHAIN_SESSION environment variable to the name of the session you want to record to:

import os
os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING""] = ""true""
os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_SESSION""] = ""my_session"" # Make sure this session actually exists. You can create a new session in the UI.










To switch sessions mid-script or mid-notebook, do NOT set the LANGCHAIN_SESSION environment variable. Instead: langchain.set_tracing_callback_manager(session_name=""my_session"")"

19,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/additional_resources/deploy_llms.html,"Deploying LLMs in Production#
In today’s fast-paced technological landscape, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly expanding. As a result, it’s crucial for developers to understand how to effectively deploy these models in production environments. LLM interfaces typically fall into two categories:


Case 1: Utilizing External LLM Providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)In this scenario, most of the computational burden is handled by the LLM providers, while LangChain simplifies the implementation of business logic around these services. This approach includes features such as prompt templating, chat message generation, caching, vector embedding database creation, preprocessing, etc.




Case 2: Self-hosted Open-Source ModelsAlternatively, developers can opt to use smaller, yet comparably capable, self-hosted open-source LLM models. This approach can significantly decrease costs, latency, and privacy concerns associated with transferring data to external LLM providers.




Regardless of the framework that forms the backbone of your product, deploying LLM applications comes with its own set of challenges. It’s vital to understand the trade-offs and key considerations when evaluating serving frameworks.

Outline#
This guide aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the requirements for deploying LLMs in a production setting, focusing on:

Designing a Robust LLM Application Service
Maintaining Cost-Efficiency
Ensuring Rapid Iteration

Understanding these components is crucial when assessing serving systems. LangChain integrates with several open-source projects designed to tackle these issues, providing a robust framework for productionizing your LLM applications. Some notable frameworks include:

Ray Serve
BentoML
Modal

These links will provide further information on each ecosystem, assisting you in finding the best fit for your LLM deployment needs.


Designing a Robust LLM Application Service#
When deploying an LLM service in production, it’s imperative to provide a seamless user experience free from outages. Achieving 24/7 service availability involves creating and maintaining several sub-systems surrounding your application.

Monitoring#
Monitoring forms an integral part of any system running in a production environment. In the context of LLMs, it is essential to monitor both performance and quality metrics.
Performance Metrics: These metrics provide insights into the efficiency and capacity of your model. Here are some key examples:

Query per second (QPS): This measures the number of queries your model processes in a second, offering insights into its utilization.
Latency: This metric quantifies the delay from when your client sends a request to when they receive a response.
Tokens Per Second (TPS): This represents the number of tokens your model can generate in a second.

Quality Metrics: These metrics are typically customized according to the business use-case. For instance, how does the output of your system compare to a baseline, such as a previous version? Although these metrics can be calculated offline, you need to log the necessary data to use them later.


Fault tolerance#
Your application may encounter errors such as exceptions in your model inference or business logic code, causing failures and disrupting traffic. Other potential issues could arise from the machine running your application, such as unexpected hardware breakdowns or loss of spot-instances during high-demand periods. One way to mitigate these risks is by increasing redundancy through replica scaling and implementing recovery mechanisms for failed replicas. However, model replicas aren’t the only potential points of failure. It’s essential to build resilience against various failures that could occur at any point in your stack.


Zero down time upgrade#
System upgrades are often necessary but can result in service disruptions if not handled correctly. One way to prevent downtime during upgrades is by implementing a smooth transition process from the old version to the new one. Ideally, the new version of your LLM service is deployed, and traffic gradually shifts from the old to the new version, maintaining a constant QPS throughout the process.


Load balancing#
Load balancing, in simple terms, is a technique to distribute work evenly across multiple computers, servers, or other resources to optimize the utilization of the system, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overload of any single resource. Think of it as a traffic officer directing cars (requests) to different roads (servers) so that no single road becomes too congested.
There are several strategies for load balancing. For example, one common method is the Round Robin strategy, where each request is sent to the next server in line, cycling back to the first when all servers have received a request. This works well when all servers are equally capable. However, if some servers are more powerful than others, you might use a Weighted Round Robin or Least Connections strategy, where more requests are sent to the more powerful servers, or to those currently handling the fewest active requests. Let’s imagine you’re running a LLM chain. If your application becomes popular, you could have hundreds or even thousands of users asking questions at the same time. If one server gets too busy (high load), the load balancer would direct new requests to another server that is less busy. This way, all your users get a timely response and the system remains stable.



Maintaining Cost-Efficiency and Scalability#
Deploying LLM services can be costly, especially when you’re handling a large volume of user interactions. Charges by LLM providers are usually based on tokens used, making a chat system inference on these models potentially expensive. However, several strategies can help manage these costs without compromising the quality of the service.

Self-hosting models#
Several smaller and open-source LLMs are emerging to tackle the issue of reliance on LLM providers. Self-hosting allows you to maintain similar quality to LLM provider models while managing costs. The challenge lies in building a reliable, high-performing LLM serving system on your own machines.


Resource Management and Auto-Scaling#
Computational logic within your application requires precise resource allocation. For instance, if part of your traffic is served by an OpenAI endpoint and another part by a self-hosted model, it’s crucial to allocate suitable resources for each. Auto-scaling—adjusting resource allocation based on traffic—can significantly impact the cost of running your application. This strategy requires a balance between cost and responsiveness, ensuring neither resource over-provisioning nor compromised application responsiveness.


Utilizing Spot Instances#
On platforms like AWS, spot instances offer substantial cost savings, typically priced at about a third of on-demand instances. The trade-off is a higher crash rate, necessitating a robust fault-tolerance mechanism for effective use.


Independent Scaling#
When self-hosting your models, you should consider independent scaling. For example, if you have two translation models, one fine-tuned for French and another for Spanish, incoming requests might necessitate different scaling requirements for each.


Batching requests#
In the context of Large Language Models, batching requests can enhance efficiency by better utilizing your GPU resources. GPUs are inherently parallel processors, designed to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. If you send individual requests to the model, the GPU might not be fully utilized as it’s only working on a single task at a time. On the other hand, by batching requests together, you’re allowing the GPU to work on multiple tasks at once, maximizing its utilization and improving inference speed. This not only leads to cost savings but can also improve the overall latency of your LLM service.
In summary, managing costs while scaling your LLM services requires a strategic approach. Utilizing self-hosting models, managing resources effectively, employing auto-scaling, using spot instances, independently scaling models, and batching requests are key strategies to consider. Open-source libraries such as Ray Serve and BentoML are designed to deal with these complexities.



Ensuring Rapid Iteration#
The LLM landscape is evolving at an unprecedented pace, with new libraries and model architectures being introduced constantly. Consequently, it’s crucial to avoid tying yourself to a solution specific to one particular framework. This is especially relevant in serving, where changes to your infrastructure can be time-consuming, expensive, and risky. Strive for infrastructure that is not locked into any specific machine learning library or framework, but instead offers a general-purpose, scalable serving layer. Here are some aspects where flexibility plays a key role:

Model composition#
Deploying systems like LangChain demands the ability to piece together different models and connect them via logic. Take the example of building a natural language input SQL query engine. Querying an LLM and obtaining the SQL command is only part of the system. You need to extract metadata from the connected database, construct a prompt for the LLM, run the SQL query on an engine, collect and feed back the response to the LLM as the query runs, and present the results to the user. This demonstrates the need to seamlessly integrate various complex components built in Python into a dynamic chain of logical blocks that can be served together.


Cloud providers#
Many hosted solutions are restricted to a single cloud provider, which can limit your options in today’s multi-cloud world. Depending on where your other infrastructure components are built, you might prefer to stick with your chosen cloud provider.


Infrastructure as Code (IaC)#
Rapid iteration also involves the ability to recreate your infrastructure quickly and reliably. This is where Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, or Kubernetes YAML files come into play. They allow you to define your infrastructure in code files, which can be version controlled and quickly deployed, enabling faster and more reliable iterations.


CI/CD#
In a fast-paced environment, implementing CI/CD pipelines can significantly speed up the iteration process. They help automate the testing and deployment of your LLM applications, reducing the risk of errors and enabling faster feedback and iteration."

This page covers how to use Yeager.ai to generate LangChain tools and agents.

What is Yeager.ai?#
Yeager.ai is an ecosystem designed to simplify the process of creating AI agents and tools.
It features yAgents, a No-code LangChain Agent Builder, which enables users to build, test, and deploy AI solutions with ease. Leveraging the LangChain framework, yAgents allows seamless integration with various language models and resources, making it suitable for developers, researchers, and AI enthusiasts across diverse applications.


yAgents#
Low code generative agent designed to help you build, prototype, and deploy Langchain tools with ease.

How to use?#
pip install yeagerai-agent
yeagerai-agent









Go to http://127.0.0.1:7860
This will install the necessary dependencies and set up yAgents on your system. After the first run, yAgents will create a .env file where you can input your OpenAI API key. You can do the same directly from the Gradio interface under the tab “Settings”.
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key_here>
We recommend using GPT-4,. However, the tool can also work with GPT-3 if the problem is broken down sufficiently.


Creating and Executing Tools with yAgents#
yAgents makes it easy to create and execute AI-powered tools. Here’s a brief overview of the process:

Create a tool: To create a tool, provide a natural language prompt to yAgents. The prompt should clearly describe the tool’s purpose and functionality. For example:
create a tool that returns the n-th prime number
Load the tool into the toolkit: To load a tool into yAgents, simply provide a command to yAgents that says so. For example:
load the tool that you just created it into your toolkit
Execute the tool: To run a tool or agent, simply provide a command to yAgents that includes the name of the tool and any required parameters. For example:
generate the 50th prime number

You can see a video of how it works here.
As you become more familiar with yAgents, you can create more advanced tools and agents to automate your work and enhance your productivity.
For more information, see yAgents’ Github or our docs"

29,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/integrations/whylabs_profiling.html,"WhyLabs#

WhyLabs is an observability platform designed to monitor data pipelines and ML applications for data quality regressions, data drift, and model performance degradation. Built on top of an open-source package called whylogs, the platform enables Data Scientists and Engineers to:

Set up in minutes: Begin generating statistical profiles of any dataset using whylogs, the lightweight open-source library.
Upload dataset profiles to the WhyLabs platform for centralized and customizable monitoring/alerting of dataset features as well as model inputs, outputs, and performance.
Integrate seamlessly: interoperable with any data pipeline, ML infrastructure, or framework. Generate real-time insights into your existing data flow. See more about our integrations here.
Scale to terabytes: handle your large-scale data, keeping compute requirements low. Integrate with either batch or streaming data pipelines.
Maintain data privacy: WhyLabs relies statistical profiles created via whylogs so your actual data never leaves your environment!
Enable observability to detect inputs and LLM issues faster, deliver continuous improvements, and avoid costly incidents.

Installation and Setup#

!pip install langkit -q

Make sure to set the required API keys and config required to send telemetry to WhyLabs:

WhyLabs API Key: https://whylabs.ai/whylabs-free-sign-up
Org and Dataset https://docs.whylabs.ai/docs/whylabs-onboarding
OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

Then you can set them like this:
import os

os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = """"
os.environ[""WHYLABS_DEFAULT_ORG_ID""] = """"
os.environ[""WHYLABS_DEFAULT_DATASET_ID""] = """"
os.environ[""WHYLABS_API_KEY""] = """"

Note: the callback supports directly passing in these variables to the callback, when no auth is directly passed in it will default to the environment. Passing in auth directly allows for writing profiles to multiple projects or organizations in WhyLabs.

Callbacks#
Here’s a single LLM integration with OpenAI, which will log various out of the box metrics and send telemetry to WhyLabs for monitoring.

This page covers how to use the Weaviate ecosystem within LangChain.
What is Weaviate?
Weaviate in a nutshell:

Weaviate is an open-source ​database of the type ​vector search engine.
Weaviate allows you to store JSON documents in a class property-like fashion while attaching machine learning vectors to these documents to represent them in vector space.
Weaviate can be used stand-alone (aka bring your vectors) or with a variety of modules that can do the vectorization for you and extend the core capabilities.
Weaviate has a GraphQL-API to access your data easily.
We aim to bring your vector search set up to production to query in mere milliseconds (check our open source benchmarks to see if Weaviate fits your use case).
Get to know Weaviate in the basics getting started guide in under five minutes.

Weaviate in detail:
Weaviate is a low-latency vector search engine with out-of-the-box support for different media types (text, images, etc.). It offers Semantic Search, Question-Answer Extraction, Classification, Customizable Models (PyTorch/TensorFlow/Keras), etc. Built from scratch in Go, Weaviate stores both objects and vectors, allowing for combining vector search with structured filtering and the fault tolerance of a cloud-native database. It is all accessible through GraphQL, REST, and various client-side programming languages.

Installation and Setup#

Install the Python SDK with pip install weaviate-client

Wrappers#

VectorStore#
There exists a wrapper around Weaviate indexes, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore,
whether for semantic search or example selection.

35,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/integrations/vectara.html,"Vectara#
What is Vectara?
Vectara Overview:

Vectara is developer-first API platform for building conversational search applications
To use Vectara - first sign up and create an account. Then create a corpus and an API key for indexing and searching.
You can use Vectara’s indexing API to add documents into Vectara’s index
You can use Vectara’s Search API to query Vectara’s index (which also supports Hybrid search implicitly).
You can use Vectara’s integration with LangChain as a Vector store or using the Retriever abstraction.

Installation and Setup#
To use Vectara with LangChain no special installation steps are required. You just have to provide your customer_id, corpus ID, and an API key created within the Vectara console to enable indexing and searching.

VectorStore#
There exists a wrapper around the Vectara platform, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore, whether for semantic search or example selection.
To import this vectorstore:
from langchain.vectorstores import Vectara

To create an instance of the Vectara vectorstore:
vectara = Vectara(
vectara_customer_id=customer_id, 
vectara_corpus_id=corpus_id, 
vectara_api_key=api_key
)

The customer_id, corpus_id and api_key are optional, and if they are not supplied will be read from the environment variables VECTARA_CUSTOMER_ID, VECTARA_CORPUS_ID and VECTARA_API_KEY, respectively.

36,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/integrations/unstructured.html,"Unstructured#

The unstructured package from
Unstructured.IO extracts clean text from raw source documents like
PDFs and Word documents.
This page covers how to use the unstructured
ecosystem within LangChain.


Installation and Setup#
If you are using a loader that runs locally, use the following steps to get unstructured and
its dependencies running locally.

Install the Python SDK with pip install ""unstructured[local-inference]""
Install the following system dependencies if they are not already available on your system.
Depending on what document types you’re parsing, you may not need all of these.

libmagic-dev (filetype detection)
poppler-utils (images and PDFs)
tesseract-ocr(images and PDFs)
libreoffice (MS Office docs)
pandoc (EPUBs)



If you want to get up and running with less set up, you can
simply run pip install unstructured and use UnstructuredAPIFileLoader or
UnstructuredAPIFileIOLoader. That will process your document using the hosted Unstructured API.
Note that currently (as of 1 May 2023) the Unstructured API is open, but it will soon require
an API. The Unstructured documentation page will have
instructions on how to generate an API key once they’re available. Check out the instructions
here
if you’d like to self-host the Unstructured API or run it locally.


Wrappers#

Data Loaders#
The primary unstructured wrappers within langchain are data loaders. The following
shows how to use the most basic unstructured data loader. There are other file-specific
data loaders available in the langchain.document_loaders module.
from langchain.document_loaders import UnstructuredFileLoader

loader = UnstructuredFileLoader(""state_of_the_union.txt"")
loader.load()









If you instantiate the loader with UnstructuredFileLoader(mode=""elements""), the loader

This page covers how to use the SearxNG search API within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to the specific SearxNG API wrapper.

Installation and Setup#
While it is possible to utilize the wrapper in conjunction withpublic searx
instances these instances frequently do not permit API
access (see note on output format below) and have limitations on the frequency
of requests. It is recommended to opt for a self-hosted instance instead.

Self Hosted Instance:#
See this page for installation instructions.
When you install SearxNG, the only active output format by default is the HTML format.
You need to activate the json format to use the API. This can be done by adding the following line to the settings.yml file:
search:
formats:
- html
- json









You can make sure that the API is working by issuing a curl request to the API endpoint:
curl -kLX GET --data-urlencode q='langchain' -d format=json http://localhost:8888
This should return a JSON object with the results.



Wrappers#

Utility#
To use the wrapper we need to pass the host of the SearxNG instance to the wrapper with:
1. the named parameter searx_host when creating the instance.
2. exporting the environment variable SEARXNG_HOST.
You can use the wrapper to get results from a SearxNG instance.
from langchain.utilities import SearxSearchWrapper
s = SearxSearchWrapper(searx_host=""http://localhost:8888"")
s.run(""what is a large language model?"")











Tool#
You can also load this wrapper as a Tool (to use with an Agent).
You can do this with:
from langchain.agents import load_tools
tools = load_tools([""searx-search""],
searx_host=""http://localhost:8888"",
engines=[""github""])









Note that we could optionally pass custom engines to use.
If you want to obtain results with metadata as json you can use:
tools = load_tools([""searx-search-results-json""],
searx_host=""http://localhost:8888"",
num_results=5)

For example, for this dolly model, click on the API tab. The model name/version would be: ""replicate/dolly-v2-12b:ef0e1aefc61f8e096ebe4db6b2bacc297daf2ef6899f0f7e001ec445893500e5""
Only the model param is required, but any other model parameters can also be passed in with the format input={model_param: value, ...}
For example, if we were running stable diffusion and wanted to change the image dimensions:
Replicate(model=""stability-ai/stable-diffusion:db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf"", input={'image_dimensions': '512x512'})









Note that only the first output of a model will be returned.
From here, we can initialize our model:
llm = Replicate(model=""replicate/dolly-v2-12b:ef0e1aefc61f8e096ebe4db6b2bacc297daf2ef6899f0f7e001ec445893500e5"")









And run it:
prompt = """"""
Answer the following yes/no question by reasoning step by step.
Can a dog drive a car?
""""""
llm(prompt)









We can call any Replicate model (not just LLMs) using this syntax. For example, we can call Stable Diffusion:
text2image = Replicate(model=""stability-ai/stable-diffusion:db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf"", input={'image_dimensions':'512x512'})

image_output = text2image(""A cat riding a motorcycle by Picasso"")

56,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/integrations/redis.html,"Redis#
This page covers how to use the Redis ecosystem within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific Redis wrappers.

Installation and Setup#

Install the Redis Python SDK with pip install redis



Wrappers#

Cache#
The Cache wrapper allows for Redis to be used as a remote, low-latency, in-memory cache for LLM prompts and responses.

Standard Cache#
The standard cache is the Redis bread & butter of use case in production for both open source and enterprise users globally.
To import this cache:
from langchain.cache import RedisCache









To use this cache with your LLMs:
import langchain
import redis

redis_client = redis.Redis.from_url(...)
langchain.llm_cache = RedisCache(redis_client)











Semantic Cache#
Semantic caching allows users to retrieve cached prompts based on semantic similarity between the user input and previously cached results. Under the hood it blends Redis as both a cache and a vectorstore.
To import this cache:
from langchain.cache import RedisSemanticCache









To use this cache with your LLMs:
import langchain
import redis

# use any embedding provider...
from tests.integration_tests.vectorstores.fake_embeddings import FakeEmbeddings

redis_url = ""redis://localhost:6379""

langchain.llm_cache = RedisSemanticCache(
embedding=FakeEmbeddings(),
redis_url=redis_url
)












VectorStore#
The vectorstore wrapper turns Redis into a low-latency vector database for semantic search or LLM content retrieval.
To import this vectorstore:
from langchain.vectorstores import Redis









For a more detailed walkthrough of the Redis vectorstore wrapper, see this notebook.


Retriever#
The Redis vector store retriever wrapper generalizes the vectorstore class to perform low-latency document retrieval. To create the retriever, simply call .as_retriever() on the base vectorstore class.


Memory#
Redis can be used to persist LLM conversations.

Vector Store Retriever Memory#
For a more detailed walkthrough of the VectorStoreRetrieverMemory wrapper, see this notebook.


Chat Message History Memory#
For a detailed example of Redis to cache conversation message history, see this notebook."

Ray Serve is a scalable model serving library for building online inference APIs. Serve is particularly well suited for system composition, enabling you to build a complex inference service consisting of multiple chains and business logic all in Python code.

Goal of this notebook#
This notebook shows a simple example of how to deploy an OpenAI chain into production. You can extend it to deploy your own self-hosted models where you can easily define amount of hardware resources (GPUs and CPUs) needed to run your model in production efficiently. Read more about available options including autoscaling in the Ray Serve documentation.


Setup Ray Serve#
Install ray with pip install ray[serve].


General Skeleton#
The general skeleton for deploying a service is the following:


# 0: Import ray serve and request from starlette
from ray import serve
from starlette.requests import Request

# 1: Define a Ray Serve deployment.
@serve.deployment
class LLMServe:

def __init__(self) -> None:
# All the initialization code goes here
pass

async def __call__(self, request: Request) -> str:
# You can parse the request here
# and return a response
return ""Hello World""

# 2: Bind the model to deployment
deployment = LLMServe.bind()

# 3: Run the deployment
serve.api.run(deployment)

# Shutdown the deployment
serve.api.shutdown()

Example of deploying and OpenAI chain with custom prompts#
Get an OpenAI API key from here. By running the following code, you will be asked to provide your API key.

from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain

from getpass import getpass
OPENAI_API_KEY = getpass()


@serve.deployment
class DeployLLM:

def __init__(self):
# We initialize the LLM, template and the chain here
llm = OpenAI(openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)
template = ""Question: {question}\n\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.""
prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=[""question""])
self.chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

def _run_chain(self, text: str):
return self.chain(text)

async def __call__(self, request: Request):
# 1. Parse the request
text = request.query_params[""text""]
# 2. Run the chain
resp = self._run_chain(text)
# 3. Return the response
return resp[""text""]

Now we can bind the deployment.

# Bind the model to deployment
deployment = DeployLLM.bind()

We can assign the port number and host when we want to run the deployment.

# Example port number
PORT_NUMBER = 8282
# Run the deployment
serve.api.run(deployment, port=PORT_NUMBER)

Now that service is deployed on port localhost:8282 we can send a post request to get the results back.

import requests

text = ""What NFL team won the Super Bowl in the year Justin Beiber was born?""
response = requests.post(f'http://localhost:{PORT_NUMBER}/?text={text}')
print(response.content.decode())

Psychic is a platform for integrating with SaaS tools like Notion, Zendesk,
Confluence, and Google Drive via OAuth and syncing documents from these applications to your SQL or vector
database. You can think of it like Plaid for unstructured data.


Installation and Setup#
pip install psychicapi

Psychic is easy to set up - you import the react library and configure it with your Sidekick API key, which you get
from the Psychic dashboard. When you connect the applications, you

view these connections from the dashboard and retrieve data using the server-side libraries.

Create an account in the dashboard.
Use the react library to add the Psychic link modal to your frontend react app. You will use this to connect the SaaS apps.
Once you have created a connection, you can use the PsychicLoader by following the example notebook

Advantages vs Other Document Loaders#

Universal API: Instead of building OAuth flows and learning the APIs for every SaaS app, you integrate Psychic once and leverage our universal API to retrieve data.
Data Syncs: Data in your customers’ SaaS apps can get stale fast. With Psychic you can configure webhooks to keep your documents up to date on a daily or realtime basis.
Simplified OAuth: Psychic handles OAuth end-to-end so that you don’t have to spend time creating OAuth clients for each integration, keeping access tokens fresh, and handling OAuth redirect logic."
62,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/integrations/promptlayer.html,"PromptLayer#

PromptLayer
is a devtool that allows you to track, manage, and share your GPT prompt engineering.
It acts as a middleware between your code and OpenAI’s python library, recording all your API requests
and saving relevant metadata for easy exploration and search in the PromptLayer dashboard.


Installation and Setup#

Install the promptlayer python library

pip install promptlayer










Create a PromptLayer account
Create an api token and set it as an environment variable (PROMPTLAYER_API_KEY)



LLM#
from langchain.llms import PromptLayerOpenAI










Example#
To tag your requests, use the argument pl_tags when instantiating the LLM
from langchain.llms import PromptLayerOpenAI
llm = PromptLayerOpenAI(pl_tags=[""langchain-requests"", ""chatbot""])









To get the PromptLayer request id, use the argument return_pl_id when instantiating the LLM
from langchain.llms import PromptLayerOpenAI
llm = PromptLayerOpenAI(return_pl_id=True)









This will add the PromptLayer request ID in the generation_info field of the Generation returned when using .generate or .agenerate
For example:
llm_results = llm.generate([""hello world""])
for res in llm_results.generations:
print(""pl request id: "", res[0].generation_info[""pl_request_id""])









You can use the PromptLayer request ID to add a prompt, score, or other metadata to your request. Read more about it here.
This LLM is identical to the OpenAI LLM, except that

all your requests will be logged to your PromptLayer account
you can add pl_tags when instantiating to tag your requests on PromptLayer
you can add return_pl_id when instantiating to return a PromptLayer request id to use while tracking requests.

Discord is a VoIP and instant messaging social platform. Users have the ability to communicate
with voice calls, video calls, text messaging, media and files in private chats or as part of communities called
“servers”. A server is a collection of persistent chat rooms and voice channels which can be accessed via invite links.


Installation and Setup#
pip install pandas









Follow these steps to download your Discord data:

Go to your User Settings
Then go to Privacy and Safety
Head over to the Request all of my Data and click on Request Data button

It might take 30 days for you to receive your data. You’ll receive an email at the address which is registered
with Discord. That email will have a download button using which you would be able to download your personal Discord data.

Diffbot is a service to read web pages. Unlike traditional web scraping tools,
Diffbot doesn’t require any rules to read the content on a page.
It starts with computer vision, which classifies a page into one of 20 possible types. Content is then interpreted by a machine learning model trained to identify the key attributes on a page based on its type.
The result is a website transformed into clean-structured data (like JSON or CSV), ready for your application.

Why Deep Lake?#

More than just a (multi-modal) vector store. You can later use the dataset to fine-tune your own LLM models.
Not only stores embeddings, but also the original data with automatic version control.
Truly serverless. Doesn’t require another service and can be used with major cloud providers (AWS S3, GCS, etc.)

This notebook covers how to connect to the Databricks runtimes and Databricks SQL using the SQLDatabase wrapper of LangChain.
It is broken into 3 parts: installation and setup, connecting to Databricks, and examples.

Installation and Setup#


!pip install databricks-sql-connector













Connecting to Databricks#
You can connect to Databricks runtimes and Databricks SQL using the SQLDatabase.from_databricks() method.

Syntax#
SQLDatabase.from_databricks(
catalog: str,
schema: str,
host: Optional[str] = None,
api_token: Optional[str] = None,
warehouse_id: Optional[str] = None,
cluster_id: Optional[str] = None,
engine_args: Optional[dict] = None,
**kwargs: Any)











Required Parameters#

catalog: The catalog name in the Databricks database.
schema: The schema name in the catalog.



Optional Parameters#
There following parameters are optional. When executing the method in a Databricks notebook, you don’t need to provide them in most of the cases.

host: The Databricks workspace hostname, excluding ‘https://’ part. Defaults to ‘DATABRICKS_HOST’ environment variable or current workspace if in a Databricks notebook.
api_token: The Databricks personal access token for accessing the Databricks SQL warehouse or the cluster. Defaults to ‘DATABRICKS_TOKEN’ environment variable or a temporary one is generated if in a Databricks notebook.
warehouse_id: The warehouse ID in the Databricks SQL.
cluster_id: The cluster ID in the Databricks Runtime. If running in a Databricks notebook and both ‘warehouse_id’ and ‘cluster_id’ are None, it uses the ID of the cluster the notebook is attached to.
engine_args: The arguments to be used when connecting Databricks.
**kwargs: Additional keyword arguments for the SQLDatabase.from_uri method.




Examples#


# Connecting to Databricks with SQLDatabase wrapper

124,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/integrations/clickhouse.html,"ClickHouse#
This page covers how to use ClickHouse Vector Search within LangChain.
ClickHouse is a open source real-time OLAP database with full SQL support and a wide range of functions to assist users in writing analytical queries. Some of these functions and data structures perform distance operations between vectors, enabling ClickHouse to be used as a vector database.
Due to the fully parallelized query pipeline, ClickHouse can process vector search operations very quickly, especially when performing exact matching through a linear scan over all rows, delivering processing speed comparable to dedicated vector databases.
High compression levels, tunable through custom compression codecs, enable very large datasets to be stored and queried. ClickHouse is not memory-bound, allowing multi-TB datasets containing embeddings to be queried.
The capabilities for computing the distance between two vectors are just another SQL function and can be effectively combined with more traditional SQL filtering and aggregation capabilities. This allows vectors to be stored and queried alongside metadata, and even rich text, enabling a broad array of use cases and applications.
Finally, experimental ClickHouse capabilities like Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) indices support faster approximate matching of vectors and provide a promising development aimed to further enhance the vector matching capabilities of ClickHouse.

Installation#

Install clickhouse server by binary or docker image
Install the Python SDK with pip install clickhouse-connect


Configure clickhouse vector index#
Customize ClickhouseSettings object with parameters
```python
from langchain.vectorstores import ClickHouse, ClickhouseSettings
config = ClickhouseSettings(host=""<clickhouse-server-host>"", port=8123, ...)

https://files.clear.ml/langchain_callback_demo/llm.988bd727b0e94a29a3ac0ee526813545/models/simple_sequentialAt this point you can already go to https://app.clear.ml and take a look at the resulting ClearML Task that was created.Among others, you should see that this notebook is saved along with any git information. The model JSON that contains the used parameters is saved as an artifact, there are also console logs and under the plots section, you’ll find tables that represent the flow of the chain.Finally, if you enabled visualizations, these are stored as HTML files under debug samples.Scenario 2: Creating an agent with tools#To show a more advanced workflow, let’s create an agent with access to tools. The way ClearML tracks the results is not different though, only the table will look slightly different as there are other types of actions taken when compared to the earlier, simpler example.You can now also see the use of the finish=True keyword, which will fully close the ClearML Task, instead of just resetting the parameters and prompts for a new conversation.from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, load_toolsfrom langchain.agents import AgentType# SCENARIO 2 - Agent with Toolstools = load_tools([""serpapi"", ""llm-math""], llm=llm, callbacks=callbacks)agent = initialize_agent(tools,llm,agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,callbacks=callbacks,)agent.run(""Who is the wife of the person who sang summer of 69?"")clearml_callback.flush_tracker(langchain_asset=agent, name=""Agent with Tools"", finish=True)> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...{'action': 'on_chain_start', 'name': 'AgentExecutor', 'step': 1, 'starts': 1, 'ends': 0, 'errors': 0, 'text_ctr': 0, 'chain_starts': 1, 'chain_ends': 0, 'llm_starts': 0, 'llm_ends': 0, 'llm_streams': 0, 'tool_starts': 0, 'tool_ends': 0, 'agent_ends': 0, 'input': 'Who is the wife of the person who sang summer of 69?'}{'action': 'on_llm_start', 'name': 'OpenAI', 'step': 2, 'starts': 2, 'ends': 0, 'errors': 0, 'text_ctr': 0, 'chain_starts': 1, 'chain_ends': 0, 'llm_starts': 1, 'llm_ends': 0, 'llm_streams': 0, 'tool_starts': 0, 'tool_ends': 0, 'agent_ends': 0, 'prompts': 'Answer the following questions as best you can.

ClearML is a ML/DL development and production suite, it contains 5 main modules:

Experiment Manager - Automagical experiment tracking, environments and results
MLOps - Orchestration, Automation & Pipelines solution for ML/DL jobs (K8s / Cloud / bare-metal)
Data-Management - Fully differentiable data management & version control solution on top of object-storage (S3 / GS / Azure / NAS)
Model-Serving - cloud-ready Scalable model serving solution!
Deploy new model endpoints in under 5 minutes
Includes optimized GPU serving support backed by Nvidia-Triton
with out-of-the-box Model Monitoring
Fire Reports - Create and share rich MarkDown documents supporting embeddable online content


In order to properly keep track of your langchain experiments and their results, you can enable the ClearML integration. We use the ClearML Experiment Manager that neatly tracks and organizes all your experiment runs.



Installation and Setup#


!pip install clearml
!pip install pandas
!pip install textstat
!pip install spacy
!python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm












Getting API Credentials#
We’ll be using quite some APIs in this notebook, here is a list and where to get them:

ClearML: https://app.clear.ml/settings/workspace-configuration
OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
SerpAPI (google search): https://serpapi.com/dashboard



import os
os.environ[""CLEARML_API_ACCESS_KEY""] = """"
os.environ[""CLEARML_API_SECRET_KEY""] = """"

os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = """"
os.environ[""SERPAPI_API_KEY""] = """"














Callbacks#


from langchain.callbacks import ClearMLCallbackHandler













from datetime import datetime
from langchain.callbacks import StdOutCallbackHandler
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

# Setup and use the ClearML Callback
clearml_callback = ClearMLCallbackHandler(
task_type=""inference"",
project_name=""langchain_callback_demo"",
task_name=""llm"",
tags=[""test""],
# Change the following parameters based on the amount of detail you want tracked
visualize=True,
complexity_metrics=True,
stream_logs=True
)
callbacks = [StdOutCallbackHandler(), clearml_callback]
# Get the OpenAI model ready to go
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, callbacks=callbacks)











The clearml callback is currently in beta and is subject to change based on updates to `langchain`. Please report any issues to https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/issues with the tag `langchain`.












Scenario 1: Just an LLM#
First, let’s just run a single LLM a few times and capture the resulting prompt-answer conversation in ClearML


# SCENARIO 1 - LLM
llm_result = llm.generate([""Tell me a joke"", ""Tell me a poem""] * 3)
# After every generation run, use flush to make sure all the metrics
# prompts and other output are properly saved separately
clearml_callback.flush_tracker(langchain_asset=llm, name=""simple_sequential"")

2023-03-29 14:00:25,948 - clearml.Task - INFO - Completed model upload to https://files.clear.ml/langchain_callback_demo/llm.988bd727b0e94a29a3ac0ee526813545/models/simple_sequential











At this point you can already go to https://app.clear.ml and take a look at the resulting ClearML Task that was created.
Among others, you should see that this notebook is saved along with any git information. The model JSON that contains the used parameters is saved as an artifact, there are also console logs and under the plots section, you’ll find tables that represent the flow of the chain.
Finally, if you enabled visualizations, these are stored as HTML files under debug samples.


Scenario 2: Creating an agent with tools#
To show a more advanced workflow, let’s create an agent with access to tools. The way ClearML tracks the results is not different though, only the table will look slightly different as there are other types of actions taken when compared to the earlier, simpler example.
You can now also see the use of the finish=True keyword, which will fully close the ClearML Task, instead of just resetting the parameters and prompts for a new conversation.

from langchain.agents import AgentType

)
agent.run(
""Who is the wife of the person who sang summer of 69?""

Could not update last created model in Task 988bd727b0e94a29a3ac0ee526813545, Task status 'completed' cannot be updated













Tips and Next Steps#

Make sure you always use a unique name argument for the clearml_callback.flush_tracker function. If not, the model parameters used for a run will override the previous run!
If you close the ClearML Callback using clearml_callback.flush_tracker(..., finish=True) the Callback cannot be used anymore. Make a new one if you want to keep logging.
Check out the rest of the open source ClearML ecosystem, there is a data version manager, a remote execution agent, automated pipelines and much more!"

Beam makes it easy to run code on GPUs, deploy scalable web APIs,
schedule cron jobs, and run massively parallel workloads — without managing any infrastructure.


Installation and Setup#

Create an account
Install the Beam CLI with curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slai-labs/get-beam/main/get-beam.sh -sSfL | sh

LLM#
from langchain.llms.beam import Beam










Example of the Beam app#
This is the environment you’ll be developing against once you start the app.
It’s also used to define the maximum response length from the model.
llm = Beam(model_name=""gpt2"",
name=""langchain-gpt2-test"",
cpu=8,
memory=""32Gi"",
gpu=""A10G"",
python_version=""python3.8"",
python_packages=[
""diffusers[torch]>=0.10"",
""transformers"",
""torch"",
""pillow"",
""accelerate"",
""safetensors"",
""xformers"",],
max_length=""50"",
verbose=False)











Deploy the Beam app#
Once defined, you can deploy your Beam app by calling your model’s _deploy() method.
llm._deploy()











Call the Beam app#
Once a beam model is deployed, it can be called by calling your model’s _call() method.
This returns the GPT2 text response to your prompt.
response = llm._call(""Running machine learning on a remote GPU"")









An example script which deploys the model and calls it would be:
from langchain.llms.beam import Beam
import time

llm = Beam(model_name=""gpt2"",
name=""langchain-gpt2-test"",
cpu=8,
memory=""32Gi"",
gpu=""A10G"",

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/integrations/bananadev.html,"Banana#
This page covers how to use the Banana ecosystem within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific Banana wrappers.

Installation and Setup#

Install with pip install banana-dev
Get an Banana api key and set it as an environment variable (BANANA_API_KEY)



Define your Banana Template#
If you want to use an available language model template you can find one here.
This template uses the Palmyra-Base model by Writer.
You can check out an example Banana repository here.


Build the Banana app#
Banana Apps must include the “output” key in the return json.
There is a rigid response structure.
# Return the results as a dictionary
result = {'output': result}









An example inference function would be:
def inference(model_inputs:dict) -> dict:
global model
global tokenizer

# Parse out your arguments
prompt = model_inputs.get('prompt', None)
if prompt == None:
return {'message': ""No prompt provided""}

# Run the model
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors='pt').cuda()
output = model.generate(
input_ids,
max_length=100,
do_sample=True,
top_k=50,
top_p=0.95,
num_return_sequences=1,
temperature=0.9,
early_stopping=True,

field powerbi: langchain.utilities.powerbi.PowerBIDataset [Required]#




field session_cache: Dict[str, Any] [Optional]#




field template: Optional[str] = '\nAnswer the question below with a DAX query that can be sent to Power BI. DAX queries have a simple syntax comprised of just one required keyword, EVALUATE, and several optional keywords: ORDER BY, START AT, DEFINE, MEASURE, VAR, TABLE, and COLUMN. Each keyword defines a statement used for the duration of the query. Any time < or > are used in the text below it means that those values need to be replaced by table, columns or other things. If the question is not something you can answer with a DAX query, reply with ""I cannot answer this"" and the question will be escalated to a human.\n\nSome DAX functions return a table instead of a scalar, and must be wrapped in a function that evaluates the table and returns a scalar; unless the table is a single column, single row table, then it is treated as a scalar value. Most DAX functions require one or more arguments, which can include tables, columns, expressions, and values. However, some functions, such as PI, do not require any arguments, but always require parentheses to indicate the null argument. For example, you must always type PI(), not PI. You can also nest functions within other functions. \n\nSome commonly used functions are:\nEVALUATE <table> - At the most basic level, a DAX query is an EVALUATE statement containing a table expression. At least one EVALUATE statement is required, however, a query can contain any number of EVALUATE statements.\nEVALUATE <table> ORDER BY <expression> ASC or DESC - The optional ORDER BY keyword defines one or more expressions used to sort query results. Any expression that can be evaluated for each row of the result is valid.\nEVALUATE <table> ORDER BY <expression> ASC or DESC START AT <value> or <parameter> - The optional START AT keyword is used inside an ORDER BY clause. It defines the value at which the query results begin.\nDEFINE MEASURE | VAR; EVALUATE <table> - The optional DEFINE keyword introduces one or more calculated entity definitions that exist only for the duration of the query. Definitions precede the EVALUATE statement and are valid for all EVALUATE statements in the query. Definitions can be variables, measures, tables1, and columns1. Definitions can reference other definitions that appear before or after the current definition. At least one definition is required if the DEFINE keyword is included in a query.\nMEASURE <table name>[<measure name>] = <scalar expression> - Introduces a measure definition in a DEFINE statement of a DAX query.\nVAR <name> = <expression> - Stores the result of an expression as a named variable, which can then be passed as an argument to other measure expressions. Once resultant values have been calculated for a variable expression, those values do not change, even if the variable is referenced in another expression.\n\nFILTER(<table>,<filter>) - Returns a table that represents a subset of another table or expression, where <filter> is a Boolean expression that is to be evaluated for each row of the table. For example, [Amount] > 0 or [Region] = ""France""\nROW(<name>, <expression>) - Returns a table with a single row containing values that result from the expressions given to each column.\nDISTINCT(<column>) - Returns a one-column table that contains the distinct values from the specified column. In other words, duplicate values are removed and only unique values are returned. This function cannot be used to Return values into a cell or column on a worksheet; rather, you nest the DISTINCT function within a formula, to get a list of distinct values that can be passed to another function and then counted, summed, or used for other operations.\nDISTINCT(<table>) - Returns a table by removing duplicate rows from another table or expression.\n\nAggregation functions, names with a A in it, handle booleans and empty strings in appropriate ways, while the same function without A only uses the numeric values in a column. Functions names with an X in it can include a expression as an argument, this will be evaluated for each row in the table and the result will be used in the regular function calculation, these are the functions:\nCOUNT(<column>), COUNTA(<column>), COUNTX(<table>,<expression>), COUNTAX(<table>,<expression>), COUNTROWS([<table>]), COUNTBLANK(<column>), DISTINCTCOUNT(<column>), DISTINCTCOUNTNOBLANK (<column>) - these are all variantions of count functions.\nAVERAGE(<column>), AVERAGEA(<column>), AVERAGEX(<table>,<expression>) - these are all variantions of average functions.\nMAX(<column>), MAXA(<column>), MAXX(<table>,<expression>) - these are all variantions of max functions.\nMIN(<column>), MINA(<column>), MINX(<table>,<expression>) - these are all variantions of min functions.\nPRODUCT(<column>), PRODUCTX(<table>,<expression>) - these are all variantions of product functions.\nSUM(<column>), SUMX(<table>,<expression>) - these are all variantions of sum functions.\n\nDate and time functions:\nDATE(year, month, day) - Returns a date value that represents the specified year, month, and day.\nDATEDIFF(date1, date2, <interval>) - Returns the difference between two date values, in the specified interval, that can be SECOND, MINUTE, HOUR, DAY, WEEK, MONTH, QUARTER, YEAR.\nDATEVALUE(<date_text>) - Returns a date value that represents the specified date.\nYEAR(<date>), QUARTER(<date>), MONTH(<date>), DAY(<date>), HOUR(<date>), MINUTE(<date>), SECOND(<date>) - Returns the part of the date for the specified date.\n\nFinally, make sure to escape double quotes with a single backslash, and make sure that only table names have single quotes around them, while names of measures or the values of columns that you want to compare against are in escaped double quotes. Newlines are not necessary and can be skipped. The queries are serialized as json and so will have to fit be compliant with json syntax. Sometimes you will get a question, a DAX query and a error, in that case you need to rewrite the DAX query to get the correct answer.\n\nThe following tables exist: {tables}\n\nand the schema\'s for some are given here:\n{schemas}\n\nExamples:\n{examples}\n\nQuestion: {tool_input}\nDAX: \n'#

pydantic model langchain.tools.ZapierNLAListActions[source]#

Returns a list of all exposed (enabled) actions associated withcurrent user (associated with the set api_key). Change your exposed
actions here: https://nla.zapier.com/demo/start/
The return list can be empty if no actions exposed. Else will contain
a list of action objects:

[{“id”: str,
“description”: str,
“params”: Dict[str, str]


}]
params will always contain an instructions key, the only required
param. All others optional and if provided will override any AI guesses
(see “understanding the AI guessing flow” here:
https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/docs)



Parameters
None – 




field api_wrapper: langchain.utilities.zapier.ZapierNLAWrapper [Optional]#






pydantic model langchain.tools.ZapierNLARunAction[source]#

Executes an action that is identified by action_id, must be exposed(enabled) by the current user (associated with the set api_key). Change
your exposed actions here: https://nla.zapier.com/demo/start/
The return JSON is guaranteed to be less than ~500 words (350
tokens) making it safe to inject into the prompt of another LLM
call.



Parameters

action_id – a specific action ID (from list actions) of the action to execute
(the set api_key must be associated with the action owner)
instructions – a natural language instruction string for using the action
(eg. “get the latest email from Mike Knoop” for “Gmail: find email” action)
params – a dict, optional. Any params provided will override AI guesses
from instructions (see “understanding the AI guessing flow” here:
https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/docs)





field action_id: str [Required]#




field api_wrapper: langchain.utilities.zapier.ZapierNLAWrapper [Optional]#




field base_prompt: str = 'A wrapper around Zapier NLA actions. The input to this tool is a natural language instruction, for example ""get the latest email from my bank"" or ""send a slack message to the #general channel"". Each tool will have params associated with it that are specified as a list. You MUST take into account the params when creating the instruction. For example, if the params are [\'Message_Text\', \'Channel\'], your instruction should be something like \'send a slack message to the #general channel with the text hello world\'. Another example: if the params are [\'Calendar\', \'Search_Term\'], your instruction should be something like \'find the meeting in my personal calendar at 3pm\'. Do not make up params, they will be explicitly specified in the tool description. If you do not have enough information to fill in the params, just say \'not enough information provided in the instruction, missing <param>\'. If you get a none or null response, STOP EXECUTION, do not try to another tool!This tool specifically used for: {zapier_description}, and has params: {params}'#

langchain.tools.tool(*args: Union[str, Callable], return_direct: bool = False, args_schema: Optional[Type[pydantic.main.BaseModel]] = None, infer_schema: bool = True) → Callable[source]#
Make tools out of functions, can be used with or without arguments.

Parameters

*args – The arguments to the tool.
return_direct – Whether to return directly from the tool rather
than continuing the agent loop.
args_schema – optional argument schema for user to specify
infer_schema – Whether to infer the schema of the arguments from
the function’s signature. This also makes the resultant tool
accept a dictionary input to its run() function.




Requires:
Function must be of type (str) -> str
Function must have a docstring



Examples
@tool
def search_api(query: str) -> str:
# Searches the API for the query.
return

@tool(""search"", return_direct=True)
def search_api(query: str) -> str:
# Searches the API for the query.
return

Official Releases#
LangChain is available on PyPi, so to it is easily installable with:
pip install langchain









That will install the bare minimum requirements of LangChain.
A lot of the value of LangChain comes when integrating it with various model providers, datastores, etc.
By default, the dependencies needed to do that are NOT installed.
However, there are two other ways to install LangChain that do bring in those dependencies.
To install modules needed for the common LLM providers, run:
pip install langchain[llms]









To install all modules needed for all integrations, run:
pip install langchain[all]









Note that if you are using zsh, you’ll need to quote square brackets when passing them as an argument to a command, for example:
pip install 'langchain[all]'











Installing from source#
If you want to install from source, you can do so by cloning the repo and running:
pip install -e .

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/evaluation/sql_qa_benchmarking_chinook.html,"SQL Question Answering Benchmarking: Chinook#
Here we go over how to benchmark performance on a question answering task over a SQL database.
It is highly reccomended that you do any evaluation/benchmarking with tracing enabled. See here for an explanation of what tracing is and how to set it up.


# Comment this out if you are NOT using tracing
import os
os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_HANDLER""] = ""langchain""












Loading the data#
First, let’s load the data.


from langchain.evaluation.loading import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset(""sql-qa-chinook"")











Downloading and preparing dataset json/LangChainDatasets--sql-qa-chinook to /Users/harrisonchase/.cache/huggingface/datasets/LangChainDatasets___json/LangChainDatasets--sql-qa-chinook-7528565d2d992b47/0.0.0/0f7e3662623656454fcd2b650f34e886a7db4b9104504885bd462096cc7a9f51...

dataset[0]











{'question': 'How many employees are there?', 'answer': '8'}













Setting up a chain#
This uses the example Chinook database.
To set it up follow the instructions on https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/, placing the .db file in a notebooks folder at the root of this repository.
Note that here we load a simple chain. If you want to experiment with more complex chains, or an agent, just create the chain object in a different way.


from langchain import OpenAI, SQLDatabase, SQLDatabaseChain













db = SQLDatabase.from_uri(""sqlite:///../../../notebooks/Chinook.db"")
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)











Now we can create a SQL database chain.


chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm, db, input_key=""question"")













Make a prediction#
First, we can make predictions one datapoint at a time. Doing it at this level of granularity allows use to explore the outputs in detail, and also is a lot cheaper than running over multiple datapoints


chain(dataset[0])











{'question': 'How many employees are there?',
 'answer': '8',
 'result': ' There are 8 employees.'}













Make many predictions#
Now we can make predictions. Note that we add a try-except because this chain can sometimes error (if SQL is written incorrectly, etc)


predictions = []
predicted_dataset = []
error_dataset = []
for data in dataset:
try:
predictions.append(chain(data))
predicted_dataset.append(data)
except:
error_dataset.append(data)













Evaluate performance#
Now we can evaluate the predictions. We can use a language model to score them programatically


from langchain.evaluation.qa import QAEvalChain













llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
eval_chain = QAEvalChain.from_llm(llm)
graded_outputs = eval_chain.evaluate(predicted_dataset, predictions, question_key=""question"", prediction_key=""result"")











We can add in the graded output to the predictions dict and then get a count of the grades.


for i, prediction in enumerate(predictions):
prediction['grade'] = graded_outputs[i]['text']













from collections import Counter
Counter([pred['grade'] for pred in predictions])











Counter({' CORRECT': 3, ' INCORRECT': 4})











We can also filter the datapoints to the incorrect examples and look at them.


incorrect = [pred for pred in predictions if pred['grade'] == "" INCORRECT""]













incorrect[0]











{'question': 'How many employees are also customers?',
 'answer': 'None',
 'result': ' 59 employees are also customers.',
 'grade': ' INCORRECT'}


"
,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/evaluation/question_answering.html,"Question Answering#
This notebook covers how to evaluate generic question answering problems. This is a situation where you have an example containing a question and its corresponding ground truth answer, and you want to measure how well the language model does at answering those questions.

Setup#
For demonstration purposes, we will just evaluate a simple question answering system that only evaluates the model’s internal knowledge. Please see other notebooks for examples where it evaluates how the model does at question answering over data not present in what the model was trained on.


from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.llms import OpenAI













prompt = PromptTemplate(template=""Question: {question}\nAnswer:"", input_variables=[""question""])













llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-003"", temperature=0)
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)













Examples#
For this purpose, we will just use two simple hardcoded examples, but see other notebooks for tips on how to get and/or generate these examples.


examples = [
{
""question"": ""Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now?"",
""answer"": ""11""
},
{
""question"": 'Is the following sentence plausible? ""Joao Moutinho caught the screen pass in the NFC championship.""',
""answer"": ""No""
}
]













Predictions#
We can now make and inspect the predictions for these questions.


predictions = chain.apply(examples)













predictions











[{'text': ' 11 tennis balls'},
 {'text': ' No, this sentence is not plausible. Joao Moutinho is a professional soccer player, not an American football player, so it is not likely that he would be catching a screen pass in the NFC championship.'}]













Evaluation#
We can see that if we tried to just do exact match on the answer answers (11 and No) they would not match what the language model answered. However, semantically the language model is correct in both cases. In order to account for this, we can use a language model itself to evaluate the answers.


from langchain.evaluation.qa import QAEvalChain













llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
eval_chain = QAEvalChain.from_llm(llm)
graded_outputs = eval_chain.evaluate(examples, predictions, question_key=""question"", prediction_key=""text"")













for i, eg in enumerate(examples):
print(f""Example {i}:"")
print(""Question: "" + eg['question'])
print(""Real Answer: "" + eg['answer'])
print(""Predicted Answer: "" + predictions[i]['text'])
print(""Predicted Grade: "" + graded_outputs[i]['text'])
print()











Example 0:
Question: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now?
Real Answer: 11
Predicted Answer:11 tennis balls
Predicted Grade:CORRECT

Example 1:
Question: Is the following sentence plausible? ""Joao Moutinho caught the screen pass in the NFC championship.""
Real Answer: No
Predicted Answer:No, this sentence is not plausible. Joao Moutinho is a professional soccer player, not an American football player, so it is not likely that he would be catching a screen pass in the NFC championship.
Predicted Grade:CORRECT













Customize Prompt#
You can also customize the prompt that is used. Here is an example prompting it using a score from 0 to 10.
The custom prompt requires 3 input variables: “query”, “answer” and “result”. Where “query” is the question, “answer” is the ground truth answer, and “result” is the predicted answer.


from langchain.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate

_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """"""You are an expert professor specialized in grading students' answers to questions.
You are grading the following question:
{query}
Here is the real answer:
{answer}
You are grading the following predicted answer:
{result}
What grade do you give from 0 to 10, where 0 is the lowest (very low similarity) and 10 is the highest (very high similarity)?
""""""

PROMPT = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[""query"", ""answer"", ""result""], template=_PROMPT_TEMPLATE)













evalchain = QAEvalChain.from_llm(llm=llm,prompt=PROMPT)
evalchain.evaluate(examples, predictions, question_key=""question"", answer_key=""answer"", prediction_key=""text"")













Evaluation without Ground Truth#
Its possible to evaluate question answering systems without ground truth. You would need a ""context"" input that reflects what the information the LLM uses to answer the question. This context can be obtained by any retreival system. Here’s an example of how it works:


context_examples = [
{
""question"": ""How old am I?"",
""context"": ""I am 30 years old. I live in New York and take the train to work everyday."",
},
{
""question"": 'Who won the NFC championship game in 2023?""',
""context"": ""NFC Championship Game 2023: Philadelphia Eagles 31, San Francisco 49ers 7""
}
]
QA_PROMPT = ""Answer the question based on thecontext\nContext:{context}\nQuestion:{question}\nAnswer:""
template = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[""context"", ""question""], template=QA_PROMPT)
qa_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=template)
predictions = qa_chain.apply(context_examples)













predictions











[{'text': 'You are 30 years old.'},
 {'text': ' The Philadelphia Eagles won the NFC championship game in 2023.'}]













from langchain.evaluation.qa import ContextQAEvalChain
eval_chain = ContextQAEvalChain.from_llm(llm)
graded_outputs = eval_chain.evaluate(context_examples, predictions, question_key=""question"", prediction_key=""text"")













graded_outputs











[{'text': ' CORRECT'}, {'text': ' CORRECT'}]













Comparing to other evaluation metrics#
We can compare the evaluation results we get to other common evaluation metrics. To do this, let’s load some evaluation metrics from HuggingFace’s evaluate package.


# Some data munging to get the examples in the right format
for i, eg in enumerate(examples):
eg['id'] = str(i)
eg['answers'] = {""text"": [eg['answer']], ""answer_start"": [0]}
predictions[i]['id'] = str(i)
predictions[i]['prediction_text'] = predictions[i]['text']

for p in predictions:
del p['text']

new_examples = examples.copy()
for eg in new_examples:
del eg ['question']
del eg['answer']

It is highly reccomended that you do any evaluation/benchmarking with tracing enabled. See here for an explanation of what tracing is and how to set it up.


# Comment this out if you are NOT using tracing
import os
os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_HANDLER""] = ""langchain""












Loading the data#
First, let’s load the data.


from langchain.evaluation.loading import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset(""question-answering-paul-graham"")











Found cached dataset json (/Users/harrisonchase/.cache/huggingface/datasets/LangChainDatasets___json/LangChainDatasets--question-answering-paul-graham-76e8f711e038d742/0.0.0/0f7e3662623656454fcd2b650f34e886a7db4b9104504885bd462096cc7a9f51)













Setting up a chain#
Now we need to create some pipelines for doing question answering. Step one in that is creating an index over the data in question.


from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
loader = TextLoader(""../../modules/paul_graham_essay.txt"")













from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator













vectorstore = VectorstoreIndexCreator().from_loaders([loader]).vectorstore











Running Chroma using direct local API.
Using DuckDB in-memory for database. Data will be transient.











Now we can create a question answering chain.


from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.llms import OpenAI













chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=OpenAI(), chain_type=""stuff"", retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(), input_key=""question"")













Make a prediction#
First, we can make predictions one datapoint at a time. Doing it at this level of granularity allows use to explore the outputs in detail, and also is a lot cheaper than running over multiple datapoints


chain(dataset[0])











{'question': 'What were the two main things the author worked on before college?',
 'answer': 'The two main things the author worked on before college were writing and programming.',
 'result': ' Writing and programming.'}













Make many predictions#
Now we can make predictions


predictions = chain.apply(dataset)













Evaluate performance#
Now we can evaluate the predictions. The first thing we can do is look at them by eye.


predictions[0]











{'question': 'What were the two main things the author worked on before college?',
 'answer': 'The two main things the author worked on before college were writing and programming.',
 'result': ' Writing and programming.'}











Next, we can use a language model to score them programatically


from langchain.evaluation.qa import QAEvalChain













llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
eval_chain = QAEvalChain.from_llm(llm)
graded_outputs = eval_chain.evaluate(dataset, predictions, question_key=""question"", prediction_key=""result"")











We can add in the graded output to the predictions dict and then get a count of the grades.


for i, prediction in enumerate(predictions):
prediction['grade'] = graded_outputs[i]['text']













from collections import Counter
Counter([pred['grade'] for pred in predictions])











Counter({' CORRECT': 12, ' INCORRECT': 10})











We can also filter the datapoints to the incorrect examples and look at them.


incorrect = [pred for pred in predictions if pred['grade'] == "" INCORRECT""]













incorrect[0]











{'question': 'What did the author write their dissertation on?',
 'answer': 'The author wrote their dissertation on applications of continuations.',
 'result': ' The author does not mention what their dissertation was on, so it is not known.',
 'grade': ' INCORRECT'}


"
,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/evaluation/openapi_eval.html,"Evaluating an OpenAPI Chain#
This notebook goes over ways to semantically evaluate an OpenAPI Chain, which calls an endpoint defined by the OpenAPI specification using purely natural language.


from langchain.tools import OpenAPISpec, APIOperation
from langchain.chains import OpenAPIEndpointChain, LLMChain
from langchain.requests import Requests
from langchain.llms import OpenAI












Load the API Chain#
Load a wrapper of the spec (so we can work with it more easily). You can load from a url or from a local file.


# Load and parse the OpenAPI Spec
spec = OpenAPISpec.from_url(""https://www.klarna.com/us/shopping/public/openai/v0/api-docs/"")
# Load a single endpoint operation
operation = APIOperation.from_openapi_spec(spec, '/public/openai/v0/products', ""get"")
verbose = False
# Select any LangChain LLM
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, max_tokens=1000)
# Create the endpoint chain
api_chain = OpenAPIEndpointChain.from_api_operation(
operation, 
llm, 
requests=Requests(), 
verbose=verbose,
return_intermediate_steps=True # Return request and response text
)











Attempting to load an OpenAPI 3.0.1 spec.This may result in degraded performance. Convert your OpenAPI spec to 3.1.* spec for better support.












Optional: Generate Input Questions and Request Ground Truth Queries#
See Generating Test Datasets at the end of this notebook for more details.


# import re
# from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

# template = """"""Below is a service description:

# {spec}

# Imagine you're a new user trying to use {operation} through a search bar. What are 10 different things you want to request?
# Wants/Questions:
# 1. """"""

# prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)

# generation_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

# questions_ = generation_chain.run(spec=operation.to_typescript(), operation=operation.operation_id).split('\n')
# # Strip preceding numeric bullets
# questions = [re.sub(r'^\d+\. ', '', q).strip() for q in questions_]
# questions













# ground_truths = [
# {""q"": ...} # What are the best queries for each input?
# ]














Run the API Chain#
The two simplest questions a user of the API Chain are:

Did the chain succesfully access the endpoint?
Did the action accomplish the correct result?

Generating Test Datasets#
To evaluate a chain against your own endpoint, you’ll want to generate a test dataset that’s conforms to the API.
This section provides an overview of how to bootstrap the process.
First, we’ll parse the OpenAPI Spec. For this example, we’ll Speak’s OpenAPI specification.


# Load and parse the OpenAPI Spec
spec = OpenAPISpec.from_url(""https://api.speak.com/openapi.yaml"")











Attempting to load an OpenAPI 3.0.1 spec.This may result in degraded performance. Convert your OpenAPI spec to 3.1.* spec for better support.
Attempting to load an OpenAPI 3.0.1 spec.This may result in degraded performance. Convert your OpenAPI spec to 3.1.* spec for better support.













# List the paths in the OpenAPI Spec
paths = sorted(spec.paths.keys())
paths











['/v1/public/openai/explain-phrase',
 '/v1/public/openai/explain-task',
 '/v1/public/openai/translate']













# See which HTTP Methods are available for a given path
methods = spec.get_methods_for_path('/v1/public/openai/explain-task')
methods











['post']













# Load a single endpoint operation
operation = APIOperation.from_openapi_spec(spec, '/v1/public/openai/explain-task', 'post')

# The operation can be serialized as typescript
print(operation.to_typescript())

This doesn’t look so good. Let’s try running some evaluation.


Evaluating the Agent#
Let’s start by defining the TrajectoryEvalChain.


from langchain.evaluation.agents import TrajectoryEvalChain

# Define chain
eval_chain = TrajectoryEvalChain.from_llm(
llm=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model_name=""gpt-4""), # Note: This must be a ChatOpenAI model
agent_tools=agent.tools,
return_reasoning=True,
)











Let’s try evaluating the first query.


question, steps, answer = test_outputs_one[""input""], test_outputs_one[""intermediate_steps""], test_outputs_one[""output""]

evaluation = eval_chain(
inputs={""question"": question, ""answer"": answer, ""agent_trajectory"": eval_chain.get_agent_trajectory(steps)},
)

print(""Score from 1 to 5: "", evaluation[""score""])
print(""Reasoning: "", evaluation[""reasoning""])











Score from 1 to 5:1
Reasoning:First, let's evaluate the final answer. The final answer is incorrect because it uses the volume of golf balls instead of ping pong balls. The answer is not helpful.

Second, does the model use a logical sequence of tools to answer the question? The model only used one tool, which was the Search the Web (SerpAPI). It did not use the Calculator tool to calculate the correct volume of ping pong balls.

Third, does the AI language model use the tools in a helpful way? The model used the Search the Web (SerpAPI) tool, but the output was not helpful because it provided information about golf balls instead of ping pong balls.

Fourth, does the AI language model use too many steps to answer the question? The model used only one step, which is not too many. However, it should have used more steps to provide a correct answer.

Fifth, are the appropriate tools used to answer the question? The model should have used the Search tool to find the volume of the Empire State Building and the volume of a ping pong ball. Then, it should have used the Calculator tool to calculate the number of ping pong balls needed to fill the building.

Judgment: Given the incorrect final answer and the inappropriate use of tools, we give the model a score of 1.











That seems about right. Let’s try the second query.


question, steps, answer = test_outputs_two[""input""], test_outputs_two[""intermediate_steps""], test_outputs_two[""output""]

evaluation = eval_chain(
inputs={""question"": question, ""answer"": answer, ""agent_trajectory"": eval_chain.get_agent_trajectory(steps)},
)

print(""Score from 1 to 5: "", evaluation[""score""])
print(""Reasoning: "", evaluation[""reasoning""])











Score from 1 to 5:3
Reasoning:i. Is the final answer helpful?
Yes, the final answer is helpful as it provides an approximate number of Eiffel Towers needed to cover the US from coast to coast.

ii. Does the AI language use a logical sequence of tools to answer the question?
No, the AI language model does not use a logical sequence of tools. It directly uses the Calculator tool without first using the Search or Lookup tools to find the necessary information (length of the Eiffel Tower and distance from coast to coast in the US).

iii. Does the AI language model use the tools in a helpful way?
The AI language model uses the Calculator tool in a helpful way to perform the calculation, but it should have used the Search or Lookup tools first to find the required information.

iv. Does the AI language model use too many steps to answer the question?
No, the AI language model does not use too many steps. However, it repeats the same step twice, which is unnecessary.

v. Are the appropriate tools used to answer the question?
Not entirely. The AI language model should have used the Search or Lookup tools to find the required information before using the Calculator tool.

Given the above evaluation, the AI language model's performance can be scored as follows:











That also sounds about right. In conclusion, the TrajectoryEvalChain allows us to use GPT-4 to score both our agent’s outputs and tool use in addition to giving us the reasoning behind the evaluation."

This notebook uses some generic prompts/language models to evaluate an question answering system that uses other sources of data besides what is in the model. For example, this can be used to evaluate a question answering system over your proprietary data.

Setup#
Let’s set up an example with our favorite example - the state of the union address.


from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA













from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
loader = TextLoader('../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt')
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
docsearch = Chroma.from_documents(texts, embeddings)
qa = RetrievalQA.from_llm(llm=OpenAI(), retriever=docsearch.as_retriever())











Running Chroma using direct local API.
Using DuckDB in-memory for database. Data will be transient.













Examples#
Now we need some examples to evaluate. We can do this in two ways:

Hard code some examples ourselves
Generate examples automatically, using a language model



# Hard-coded examples
examples = [
{
""query"": ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"",
""answer"": ""He praised her legal ability and said he nominated her for the supreme court.""
},
{
""query"": ""What did the president say about Michael Jackson"",
""answer"": ""Nothing""
}
]













# Generated examples
from langchain.evaluation.qa import QAGenerateChain
example_gen_chain = QAGenerateChain.from_llm(OpenAI())













new_examples = example_gen_chain.apply_and_parse([{""doc"": t} for t in texts[:5]])













new_examples











[{'query': 'According to the document, what did Vladimir Putin miscalculate?',
'answer': 'He miscalculated that he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over.'},
 {'query': 'Who is the Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States?',
'answer': 'The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight.'},
 {'query': 'How many countries were part of the coalition formed to confront Putin?',
'answer': '27 members of the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland.'},
 {'query': 'What action is the U.S. Department of Justice taking to target Russian oligarchs?',
'answer': 'The U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs and joining with European allies to find and seize their yachts, luxury apartments, and private jets.'},
 {'query': 'How much direct assistance is the United States providing to Ukraine?',
'answer': 'The United States is providing more than $1 Billion in direct assistance to Ukraine.'}]













# Combine examples
examples += new_examples













Evaluate#
Now that we have examples, we can use the question answering evaluator to evaluate our question answering chain.


from langchain.evaluation.qa import QAEvalChain













predictions = qa.apply(examples)













llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
eval_chain = QAEvalChain.from_llm(llm)

Example 0:
Question: What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson
Real Answer: He praised her legal ability and said he nominated her for the supreme court.
Predicted Answer:The president said that she is one of the nation's top legal minds, a former top litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender, and from a family of public school educators and police officers. He also said that she is a consensus builder and that she has received a broad range of support from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by both Democrats and Republicans.
Predicted Grade:CORRECT

Example 1:
Question: What did the president say about Michael Jackson
Real Answer: Nothing
Predicted Answer:The president did not mention Michael Jackson in this speech.
Predicted Grade:CORRECT

Example 2:
Question: According to the document, what did Vladimir Putin miscalculate?
Real Answer: He miscalculated that he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over.
Predicted Answer:Putin miscalculated that the world would roll over when he rolled into Ukraine.
Predicted Grade:CORRECT

Example 3:
Question: Who is the Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States?
Real Answer: The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight.
Predicted Answer:I don't know.

Predicted Answer:The coalition included freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa, 27 members of the European Union including France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland.
Predicted Grade:INCORRECT

Example 5:
Question: What action is the U.S. Department of Justice taking to target Russian oligarchs?
Real Answer: The U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs and joining with European allies to find and seize their yachts, luxury apartments, and private jets.
Predicted Answer:The U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs and to find and seize their yachts, luxury apartments, and private jets.
Predicted Grade:INCORRECT

Example 6:
Question: How much direct assistance is the United States providing to Ukraine?
Real Answer: The United States is providing more than $1 Billion in direct assistance to Ukraine.
Predicted Answer:The United States is providing more than $1 billion in direct assistance to Ukraine.
Predicted Grade:CORRECT













Evaluate with Other Metrics#
In addition to predicting whether the answer is correct or incorrect using a language model, we can also use other metrics to get a more nuanced view on the quality of the answers. To do so, we can use the Critique library, which allows for simple calculation of various metrics over generated text.
First you can get an API key from the Inspired Cognition Dashboard and do some setup:
export INSPIREDCO_API_KEY=""...""
pip install inspiredco











import inspiredco.critique
import os
critique = inspiredco.critique.Critique(api_key=os.environ['INSPIREDCO_API_KEY'])











Then run the following code to set up the configuration and calculate the ROUGE, chrf, BERTScore, and UniEval (you can choose other metrics too):


metrics = {
""rouge"": {
""metric"": ""rouge"",
""config"": {""variety"": ""rouge_l""},
},
""chrf"": {
""metric"": ""chrf"",
""config"": {},
},
""bert_score"": {
""metric"": ""bert_score"",
""config"": {""model"": ""bert-base-uncased""},
},
""uni_eval"": {
""metric"": ""uni_eval"",
""config"": {""task"": ""summarization"", ""evaluation_aspect"": ""relevance""},
},
}













critique_data = [
{""target"": pred['result'], ""references"": [pred['answer']]} for pred in predictions
]
eval_results = {
k: critique.evaluate(dataset=critique_data, metric=v[""metric""], config=v[""config""])
for k, v in metrics.items()
}











Finally, we can print out the results. We can see that overall the scores are higher when the output is semantically correct, and also when the output closely matches with the gold-standard answer.


for i, eg in enumerate(examples):
score_string = "", "".join([f""{k}={v['examples'][i]['value']:.4f}"" for k, v in eval_results.items()])
print(f""Example {i}:"")
print(""Question: "" + predictions[i]['query'])
print(""Real Answer: "" + predictions[i]['answer'])
print(""Predicted Answer: "" + predictions[i]['result'])
print(""Predicted Scores: "" + score_string)
print()

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/evaluation.html,"Evaluation#

Note
Conceptual Guide

This section of documentation covers how we approach and think about evaluation in LangChain.
Both evaluation of internal chains/agents, but also how we would recommend people building on top of LangChain approach evaluation.

The Problem#
It can be really hard to evaluate LangChain chains and agents.
There are two main reasons for this:
# 1: Lack of data
You generally don’t have a ton of data to evaluate your chains/agents over before starting a project.
This is usually because Large Language Models (the core of most chains/agents) are terrific few-shot and zero shot learners,
meaning you are almost always able to get started on a particular task (text-to-SQL, question answering, etc) without
a large dataset of examples.
This is in stark contrast to traditional machine learning where you had to first collect a bunch of datapoints
before even getting started using a model.
# 2: Lack of metrics
Most chains/agents are performing tasks for which there are not very good metrics to evaluate performance.
For example, one of the most common use cases is generating text of some form.
Evaluating generated text is much more complicated than evaluating a classification prediction, or a numeric prediction.


The Solution#
LangChain attempts to tackle both of those issues.
What we have so far are initial passes at solutions - we do not think we have a perfect solution.
So we very much welcome feedback, contributions, integrations, and thoughts on this.
Here is what we have for each problem so far:
# 1: Lack of data
We have started LangChainDatasets a Community space on Hugging Face.
We intend this to be a collection of open source datasets for evaluating common chains and agents.
We have contributed five datasets of our own to start, but we highly intend this to be a community effort.
In order to contribute a dataset, you simply need to join the community and then you will be able to upload datasets.
We’re also aiming to make it as easy as possible for people to create their own datasets.
As a first pass at this, we’ve added a QAGenerationChain, which given a document comes up
with question-answer pairs that can be used to evaluate question-answering tasks over that document down the line.
See this notebook for an example of how to use this chain.
# 2: Lack of metrics
We have two solutions to the lack of metrics.
The first solution is to use no metrics, and rather just rely on looking at results by eye to get a sense for how the chain/agent is performing.
To assist in this, we have developed (and will continue to develop) tracing, a UI-based visualizer of your chain and agent runs.
The second solution we recommend is to use Language Models themselves to evaluate outputs.
For this we have a few different chains and prompts aimed at tackling this issue.


The Examples#
We have created a bunch of examples combining the above two solutions to show how we internally evaluate chains and agents when we are developing.
In addition to the examples we’ve curated, we also highly welcome contributions here.
To facilitate that, we’ve included a template notebook for community members to use to build their own examples.
The existing examples we have are:
Question Answering (State of Union): A notebook showing evaluation of a question-answering task over a State-of-the-Union address.
Question Answering (Paul Graham Essay): A notebook showing evaluation of a question-answering task over a Paul Graham essay.
SQL Question Answering (Chinook): A notebook showing evaluation of a question-answering task over a SQL database (the Chinook database).
Agent Vectorstore: A notebook showing evaluation of an agent doing question answering while routing between two different vector databases.
Agent Search + Calculator: A notebook showing evaluation of an agent doing question answering using a Search engine and a Calculator as tools.
Evaluating an OpenAPI Chain: A notebook showing evaluation of an OpenAPI chain, including how to generate test data if you don’t have any.


Other Examples#
In addition, we also have some more generic resources for evaluation.
Question Answering: An overview of LLMs aimed at evaluating question answering systems in general.
Data Augmented Question Answering: An end-to-end example of evaluating a question answering system focused on a specific document (a RetrievalQAChain to be precise). This example highlights how to use LLMs to come up with question/answer examples to evaluate over, and then highlights how to use LLMs to evaluate performance on those generated examples.

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/summarization.html,"Summarization#

Conceptual Guide

Summarization involves creating a smaller summary of multiple longer documents.
This can be useful for distilling long documents into the core pieces of information.
The recommended way to get started using a summarization chain is:
from langchain.chains.summarize import load_summarize_chain
chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type=""map_reduce"")
chain.run(docs)









The following resources exist:

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/extraction.html,"Extraction#

Conceptual Guide

Most APIs and databases still deal with structured information.
Therefore, in order to better work with those, it can be useful to extract structured information from text.
Examples of this include:

Extracting a structured row to insert into a database from a sentence
Extracting multiple rows to insert into a database from a long document
Extracting the correct API parameters from a user query

This work is extremely related to output parsing.
Output parsers are responsible for instructing the LLM to respond in a specific format.
In this case, the output parsers specify the format of the data you would like to extract from the document.
Then, in addition to the output format instructions, the prompt should also contain the data you would like to extract information from.
While normal output parsers are good enough for basic structuring of response data,
when doing extraction you often want to extract more complicated or nested structures.
For a deep dive on extraction, we recommend checking out kor,
a library that uses the existing LangChain chain and OutputParser abstractions
but deep dives on allowing extraction of more complicated schemas."
,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/apis.html,"Interacting with APIs#

Conceptual Guide

Lots of data and information is stored behind APIs.
This page covers all resources available in LangChain for working with APIs.

Chains#
If you are just getting started, and you have relatively simple apis, you should get started with chains.
Chains are a sequence of predetermined steps, so they are good to get started with as they give you more control and let you
understand what is happening better.

API Chain



Agents#
Agents are more complex, and involve multiple queries to the LLM to understand what to do.
The downside of agents are that you have less control. The upside is that they are more powerful,
which allows you to use them on larger and more complex schemas.

OpenAPI Agent"
,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/code.html,"Code Understanding#
Overview
LangChain is a useful tool designed to parse GitHub code repositories. By leveraging VectorStores, Conversational RetrieverChain, and GPT-4, it can answer questions in the context of an entire GitHub repository or generate new code. This documentation page outlines the essential components of the system and guides using LangChain for better code comprehension, contextual question answering, and code generation in GitHub repositories.

Conversational Retriever Chain#
Conversational RetrieverChain is a retrieval-focused system that interacts with the data stored in a VectorStore. Utilizing advanced techniques, like context-aware filtering and ranking, it retrieves the most relevant code snippets and information for a given user query. Conversational RetrieverChain is engineered to deliver high-quality, pertinent results while considering conversation history and context.
LangChain Workflow for Code Understanding and Generation

Index the code base: Clone the target repository, load all files within, chunk the files, and execute the indexing process. Optionally, you can skip this step and use an already indexed dataset.
Embedding and Code Store: Code snippets are embedded using a code-aware embedding model and stored in a VectorStore.
Query Understanding: GPT-4 processes user queries, grasping the context and extracting relevant details.
Construct the Retriever: Conversational RetrieverChain searches the VectorStore to identify the most relevant code snippets for a given query.
Build the Conversational Chain: Customize the retriever settings and define any user-defined filters as needed.
Ask questions: Define a list of questions to ask about the codebase, and then use the ConversationalRetrievalChain to generate context-aware answers. The LLM (GPT-4) generates comprehensive, context-aware answers based on retrieved code snippets and conversation history.

Conceptual Guide

Lots of data and information is stored in tabular data, whether it be csvs, excel sheets, or SQL tables.
This page covers all resources available in LangChain for working with data in this format.

Document Loading#
If you have text data stored in a tabular format, you may want to load the data into a Document and then index it as you would
other text/unstructured data. For this, you should use a document loader like the CSVLoader
and then you should create an index over that data, and query it that way.


Querying#
If you have more numeric tabular data, or have a large amount of data and don’t want to index it, you should get started
by looking at various chains and agents we have for dealing with this data.

Chains#
If you are just getting started, and you have relatively small/simple tabular data, you should get started with chains.
Chains are a sequence of predetermined steps, so they are good to get started with as they give you more control and let you
understand what is happening better.

SQL Database Chain



Agents#
Agents are more complex, and involve multiple queries to the LLM to understand what to do.
The downside of agents are that you have less control. The upside is that they are more powerful,
which allows you to use them on larger databases and more complex schemas.

SQL Agent

Conceptual Guide

Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.
Aside from the base prompts/LLMs, an important concept to know for Chatbots is memory.
Most chat based applications rely on remembering what happened in previous interactions, which memory is designed to help with.

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/question_answering.html,"Question Answering over Docs#

Conceptual Guide

Question answering in this context refers to question answering over your document data.
For question answering over other types of data, please see other sources documentation like SQL database Question Answering or Interacting with APIs.
For question answering over many documents, you almost always want to create an index over the data.
This can be used to smartly access the most relevant documents for a given question, allowing you to avoid having to pass all the documents to the LLM (saving you time and money).
See this notebook for a more detailed introduction to this, but for a super quick start the steps involved are:
Load Your Documents
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
loader = TextLoader('../state_of_the_union.txt')









See here for more information on how to get started with document loading.
Create Your Index
from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator
index = VectorstoreIndexCreator().from_loaders([loader])









The best and most popular index by far at the moment is the VectorStore index.
Query Your Index
query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
index.query(query)









Alternatively, use query_with_sources to also get back the sources involved
query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
index.query_with_sources(query)









Again, these high level interfaces obfuscate a lot of what is going on under the hood, so please see this notebook for a lower level walkthrough.

Document Question Answering#
Question answering involves fetching multiple documents, and then asking a question of them.
The LLM response will contain the answer to your question, based on the content of the documents.
The recommended way to get started using a question answering chain is:
from langchain.chains.question_answering import load_qa_chain
chain = load_qa_chain(llm, chain_type=""stuff"")
chain.run(input_documents=docs, question=query)









The following resources exist:

Question Answering Notebook: A notebook walking through how to accomplish this task.
VectorDB Question Answering Notebook: A notebook walking through how to do question answering over a vector database. This can often be useful for when you have a LOT of documents, and you don’t want to pass them all to the LLM, but rather first want to do some semantic search over embeddings.



Adding in sources#
There is also a variant of this, where in addition to responding with the answer the language model will also cite its sources (eg which of the documents passed in it used).
The recommended way to get started using a question answering with sources chain is:
from langchain.chains.qa_with_sources import load_qa_with_sources_chain
chain = load_qa_with_sources_chain(llm, chain_type=""stuff"")
chain({""input_documents"": docs, ""question"": query}, return_only_outputs=True)

Conceptual Guide

Agents can be used for a variety of tasks.
Agents combine the decision making ability of a language model with tools in order to create a system
that can execute and implement solutions on your behalf. Before reading any more, it is highly
recommended that you read the documentation in the agent module to understand the concepts associated with agents more.
Specifically, you should be familiar with what the agent, tool, and agent executor abstractions are before reading more.

Agent Documentation (for interacting with the outside world)


Create Your Own Agent#
Once you have read that documentation, you should be prepared to create your own agent.
What exactly does that involve?
Here’s how we recommend getting started with creating your own agent:

Step 1: Create Tools#
Agents are largely defined by the tools they can use.
If you have a specific task you want the agent to accomplish, you have to give it access to the right tools.
We have many tools natively in LangChain, so you should first look to see if any of them meet your needs.
But we also make it easy to define a custom tool, so if you need custom tools you should absolutely do that.


(Optional) Step 2: Modify Agent#
The built-in LangChain agent types are designed to work well in generic situations,
but you may be able to improve performance by modifying the agent implementation.
There are several ways you could do this:

Modify the base prompt. This can be used to give the agent more context on how it should behave, etc.
Modify the output parser. This is necessary if the agent is having trouble parsing the language model output.



(Optional) Step 3: Modify Agent Executor#
This step is usually not necessary, as this is pretty general logic.
Possible reasons you would want to modify this include adding different stopping conditions, or handling errors



Examples#
Specific examples of agents include:

AI Plugins: an implementation of an agent that is designed to be able to use all AI Plugins.
Plug-and-PlAI (Plugins Database): an implementation of an agent that is designed to be able to use all AI Plugins retrieved from PlugNPlAI.
Wikibase Agent: an implementation of an agent that is designed to interact with Wikibase.
Sales GPT: This notebook demonstrates an implementation of a Context-Aware AI Sales agent.
Multi-Modal Output Agent: an implementation of a multi-modal output agent that can generate text and images."
,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/agent_simulations.html,"Agent Simulations#
Agent simulations involve interacting one of more agents with each other.
Agent simulations generally involve two main components:

Long Term Memory
Simulation Environment

Specific implementations of agent simulations (or parts of agent simulations) include:

Simulations with One Agent#

Simulated Environment: Gymnasium: an example of how to create a simple agent-environment interaction loop with Gymnasium (formerly OpenAI Gym).



Simulations with Two Agents#

CAMEL: an implementation of the CAMEL (Communicative Agents for “Mind” Exploration of Large Scale Language Model Society) paper, where two agents communicate with each other.
Two Player D&D: an example of how to use a generic simulator for two agents to implement a variant of the popular Dungeons & Dragons role playing game.
Agent Debates with Tools: an example of how to enable Dialogue Agents to use tools to inform their responses.



Simulations with Multiple Agents#

Multi-Player D&D: an example of how to use a generic dialogue simulator for multiple dialogue agents with a custom speaker-ordering, illustrated with a variant of the popular Dungeons & Dragons role playing game.
Decentralized Speaker Selection: an example of how to implement a multi-agent dialogue without a fixed schedule for who speaks when. Instead the agents decide for themselves who speaks by outputting bids to speak. This example shows how to do this in the context of a fictitious presidential debate.
Authoritarian Speaker Selection: an example of how to implement a multi-agent dialogue, where a privileged agent directs who speaks what. This example also showcases how to enable the privileged agent to determine when the conversation terminates. This example shows how to do this in the context of a fictitious news show.
Simulated Environment: PettingZoo: an example of how to create a agent-environment interaction loop for multiple agents with PettingZoo (a multi-agent version of Gymnasium).
Generative Agents: This notebook implements a generative agent based on the paper Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior by Park, et. al."
,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/autonomous_agents.html,"Autonomous Agents#
Autonomous Agents are agents that designed to be more long running.
You give them one or multiple long term goals, and they independently execute towards those goals.
The applications combine tool usage and long term memory.
At the moment, Autonomous Agents are fairly experimental and based off of other open-source projects.
By implementing these open source projects in LangChain primitives we can get the benefits of LangChain -
easy switching and experimenting with multiple LLMs, usage of different vectorstores as memory,
usage of LangChain’s collection of tools.

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/callbacks/getting_started.html,"Callbacks#
LangChain provides a callbacks system that allows you to hook into the various stages of your LLM application. This is useful for logging, monitoring, streaming, and other tasks.
You can subscribe to these events by using the callbacks argument available throughout the API. This argument is list of handler objects, which are expected to implement one or more of the methods described below in more detail. There are two main callbacks mechanisms:

Constructor callbacks will be used for all calls made on that object, and will be scoped to that object only, i.e. if you pass a handler to the LLMChain constructor, it will not be used by the model attached to that chain.
Request callbacks will be used for that specific request only, and all sub-requests that it contains (eg. a call to an LLMChain triggers a call to a Model, which uses the same handler passed through). These are explicitly passed through.

Advanced: When you create a custom chain you can easily set it up to use the same callback system as all the built-in chains.
_call, _generate, _run, and equivalent async methods on Chains / LLMs / Chat Models / Agents / Tools now receive a 2nd argument called run_manager which is bound to that run, and contains the logging methods that can be used by that object (i.e. on_llm_new_token). This is useful when constructing a custom chain. See this guide for more information on how to create custom chains and use callbacks inside them.
CallbackHandlers are objects that implement the CallbackHandler interface, which has a method for each event that can be subscribed to. The CallbackManager will call the appropriate method on each handler when the event is triggered.
class BaseCallbackHandler:
""""""Base callback handler that can be used to handle callbacks from langchain.""""""

def on_llm_start(

def on_agent_finish(self, finish: AgentFinish, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:

How to use callbacks#
The callbacks argument is available on most objects throughout the API (Chains, Models, Tools, Agents, etc.) in two different places:

Constructor callbacks: defined in the constructor, eg. LLMChain(callbacks=[handler]), which will be used for all calls made on that object, and will be scoped to that object only, eg. if you pass a handler to the LLMChain constructor, it will not be used by the Model attached to that chain.
Request callbacks: defined in the call()/run()/apply() methods used for issuing a request, eg. chain.call(inputs, callbacks=[handler]), which will be used for that specific request only, and all sub-requests that it contains (eg. a call to an LLMChain triggers a call to a Model, which uses the same handler passed in the call() method).

The verbose argument is available on most objects throughout the API (Chains, Models, Tools, Agents, etc.) as a constructor argument, eg. LLMChain(verbose=True), and it is equivalent to passing a ConsoleCallbackHandler to the callbacks argument of that object and all child objects. This is useful for debugging, as it will log all events to the console.

When do you want to use each of these?#

Constructor callbacks are most useful for use cases such as logging, monitoring, etc., which are not specific to a single request, but rather to the entire chain. For example, if you want to log all the requests made to an LLMChain, you would pass a handler to the constructor.
Request callbacks are most useful for use cases such as streaming, where you want to stream the output of a single request to a specific websocket connection, or other similar use cases. For example, if you want to stream the output of a single request to a websocket, you would pass a handler to the call() method




Using an existing handler#
LangChain provides a few built-in handlers that you can use to get started. These are available in the langchain/callbacks module. The most basic handler is the StdOutCallbackHandler, which simply logs all events to stdout. In the future we will add more default handlers to the library.
Note when the verbose flag on the object is set to true, the StdOutCallbackHandler will be invoked even without being explicitly passed in.


from langchain.callbacks import StdOutCallbackHandler
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

handler = StdOutCallbackHandler()
llm = OpenAI()
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""1 + {number} = "")

# First, let's explicitly set the StdOutCallbackHandler in `callbacks`
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, callbacks=[handler])
chain.run(number=2)

# Then, let's use the `verbose` flag to achieve the same result
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True)
chain.run(number=2)

# Finally, let's use the request `callbacks` to achieve the same result
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)
chain.run(number=2, callbacks=[handler])

1 + 2 = 

> Finished chain.


> Entering new LLMChain chain...
Prompt after formatting:
1 + 2 = 

> Finished chain.


> Entering new LLMChain chain...
Prompt after formatting:
1 + 2 = 

> Finished chain.









'\n\n3'













Creating a custom handler#
You can create a custom handler to set on the object as well. In the example below, we’ll implement streaming with a custom handler.


from langchain.callbacks.base import BaseCallbackHandler
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage

class MyCustomHandler(BaseCallbackHandler):
def on_llm_new_token(self, token: str, **kwargs) -> None:
print(f""My custom handler, token: {token}"")

# To enable streaming, we pass in `streaming=True` to the ChatModel constructor
# Additionally, we pass in a list with our custom handler
chat = ChatOpenAI(max_tokens=25, streaming=True, callbacks=[MyCustomHandler()])

chat([HumanMessage(content=""Tell me a joke"")])











My custom handler, token: 
My custom handler, token: Why
My custom handler, token:did
My custom handler, token:the
My custom handler, token:tomato
My custom handler, token:turn
My custom handler, token:red
My custom handler, token: ?
My custom handler, token:Because
My custom handler, token:it
My custom handler, token:saw
My custom handler, token:the
My custom handler, token:salad
My custom handler, token:dressing
My custom handler, token: !
My custom handler, token: 









AIMessage(content='Why did the tomato turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing!', additional_kwargs={})













Async Callbacks#
If you are planning to use the async API, it is recommended to use AsyncCallbackHandler to avoid blocking the runloop.
Advanced if you use a sync CallbackHandler while using an async method to run your llm/chain/tool/agent, it will still work. However, under the hood, it will be called with run_in_executor which can cause issues if your CallbackHandler is not thread-safe.


import asyncio
from typing import Any, Dict, List
from langchain.schema import LLMResult
from langchain.callbacks.base import AsyncCallbackHandler

class MyCustomSyncHandler(BaseCallbackHandler):
def on_llm_new_token(self, token: str, **kwargs) -> None:
print(f""Sync handler being called in a `thread_pool_executor`: token: {token}"")

class MyCustomAsyncHandler(AsyncCallbackHandler):
""""""Async callback handler that can be used to handle callbacks from langchain.""""""

async def on_llm_start(
self, serialized: Dict[str, Any], prompts: List[str], **kwargs: Any
) -> None:
""""""Run when chain starts running.""""""
print(""zzzz...."")
await asyncio.sleep(0.3)
class_name = serialized[""name""]
print(""Hi! I just woke up. Your llm is starting"")

async def on_llm_end(self, response: LLMResult, **kwargs: Any) -> None:
""""""Run when chain ends running.""""""
print(""zzzz...."")
await asyncio.sleep(0.3)
print(""Hi! I just woke up. Your llm is ending"")

# To enable streaming, we pass in `streaming=True` to the ChatModel constructor
# Additionally, we pass in a list with our custom handler
chat = ChatOpenAI(max_tokens=25, streaming=True, callbacks=[MyCustomSyncHandler(), MyCustomAsyncHandler()])

await chat.agenerate([[HumanMessage(content=""Tell me a joke"")]])

Using multiple handlers, passing in handlers#
In the previous examples, we passed in callback handlers upon creation of an object by using callbacks=. In this case, the callbacks will be scoped to that particular object.
However, in many cases, it is advantageous to pass in handlers instead when running the object. When we pass through CallbackHandlers using the callbacks keyword arg when executing an run, those callbacks will be issued by all nested objects involved in the execution. For example, when a handler is passed through to an Agent, it will be used for all callbacks related to the agent and all the objects involved in the agent’s execution, in this case, the Tools, LLMChain, and LLM.
This prevents us from having to manually attach the handlers to each individual nested object.

Tracing and Token Counting#
Tracing and token counting are two capabilities we provide which are built on our callbacks mechanism.

Tracing#
There are two recommended ways to trace your LangChains:

Setting the LANGCHAIN_TRACING environment variable to ""true"".
Using a context manager with tracing_enabled() to trace a particular block of code.

Note if the environment variable is set, all code will be traced, regardless of whether or not it’s within the context manager.

Token Counting#
LangChain offers a context manager that allows you to count tokens.


from langchain.callbacks import get_openai_callback

with get_openai_callback() as cb:
llm(""What is the square root of 4?"")

total_tokens = cb.total_tokens

with get_openai_callback() as cb:
llm(""What is the square root of 4?"")
llm(""What is the square root of 4?"")

assert cb.total_tokens == total_tokens * 2

# You can kick off concurrent runs from within the context manager
with get_openai_callback() as cb:
await asyncio.gather(
*[llm.agenerate([""What is the square root of 4?""]) for _ in range(3)]
)

assert cb.total_tokens == total_tokens * 3

# The context manager is concurrency safe
task = asyncio.create_task(llm.agenerate([""What is the square root of 4?""]))
with get_openai_callback() as cb:
await llm.agenerate([""What is the square root of 4?""])

await task

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/plan_and_execute.html,"Plan and Execute#
Plan and execute agents accomplish an objective by first planning what to do, then executing the sub tasks. This idea is largely inspired by BabyAGI and then the “Plan-and-Solve” paper.
The planning is almost always done by an LLM.
The execution is usually done by a separate agent (equipped with tools).

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/agent_executors/examples/sharedmemory_for_tools.html,"How to add SharedMemory to an Agent and its Tools#
This notebook goes over adding memory to both of an Agent and its tools. Before going through this notebook, please walk through the following notebooks, as this will build on top of both of them:

Adding memory to an LLM Chain
Custom Agents

We are going to create a custom Agent. The agent has access to a conversation memory, search tool, and a summarization tool. And, the summarization tool also needs access to the conversation memory.


from langchain.agents import ZeroShotAgent, Tool, AgentExecutor
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory, ReadOnlySharedMemory
from langchain import OpenAI, LLMChain, PromptTemplate
from langchain.utilities import GoogleSearchAPIWrapper













template = """"""This is a conversation between a human and a bot:

{chat_history}

Write a summary of the conversation for {input}:
""""""

prompt = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=[""input"", ""chat_history""], 
template=template
)
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"")
readonlymemory = ReadOnlySharedMemory(memory=memory)
summry_chain = LLMChain(
llm=OpenAI(), 
prompt=prompt, 
verbose=True, 
memory=readonlymemory, # use the read-only memory to prevent the tool from modifying the memory
)













search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper()
tools = [
Tool(
name = ""Search"",
func=search.run,
description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events""
),
Tool(
name = ""Summary"",
func=summry_chain.run,
description=""useful for when you summarize a conversation. The input to this tool should be a string, representing who will read this summary.""
)
]













prefix = """"""Have a conversation with a human, answering the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:""""""
suffix = """"""Begin!""

{agent_scratchpad}""""""

prompt = ZeroShotAgent.create_prompt(
tools, 
prefix=prefix, 
suffix=suffix, 
input_variables=[""input"", ""chat_history"", ""agent_scratchpad""]
)











We can now construct the LLMChain, with the Memory object, and then create the agent.


llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), prompt=prompt)
agent = ZeroShotAgent(llm_chain=llm_chain, tools=tools, verbose=True)

It is built on top of OpenAI's GPT-3 family of large language models and is optimized for dialogue by using Reinforcement Learning with Human-in-the-Loop. It is also capable of sending and receiving images during chatting.
Human: Who developed it?
AI: ChatGPT was developed by OpenAI.

Write a summary of the conversation for My daughter 5 years old:

'ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI that can have conversations with humans and send and receive images.'











The final answer is not wrong, but we see the 3rd Human input is actually from the agent in the memory because the memory was modified by the summary tool.

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/agent_executors/examples/async_agent.html,"How to use the async API for Agents#
LangChain provides async support for Agents by leveraging the asyncio library.
Async methods are currently supported for the following Tools: GoogleSerperAPIWrapper, SerpAPIWrapper and LLMMathChain. Async support for other agent tools are on the roadmap.
For Tools that have a coroutine implemented (the three mentioned above), the AgentExecutor will await them directly. Otherwise, the AgentExecutor will call the Tool’s func via asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor to avoid blocking the main runloop.
You can use arun to call an AgentExecutor asynchronously.

Serial vs. Concurrent Execution#
In this example, we kick off agents to answer some questions serially vs. concurrently. You can see that concurrent execution significantly speeds this up.

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/agent_executors/examples/agent_vectorstore.html,"How to combine agents and vectorstores#
This notebook covers how to combine agents and vectorstores. The use case for this is that you’ve ingested your data into a vectorstore and want to interact with it in an agentic manner.
The recommended method for doing so is to create a RetrievalQA and then use that as a tool in the overall agent. Let’s take a look at doing this below. You can do this with multiple different vectordbs, and use the agent as a way to route between them. There are two different ways of doing this - you can either let the agent use the vectorstores as normal tools, or you can set return_direct=True to really just use the agent as a router.

You can also set return_direct=True if you intend to use the agent as a router and just want to directly return the result of the RetrievalQAChain.
Notice that in the above examples the agent did some extra work after querying the RetrievalQAChain. You can avoid that and just return the result directly.

This notebook showcases an agent designed to interact with a Power BI Dataset. The agent is designed to answer more general questions about a dataset, as well as recover from errors.
Note that, as this agent is in active development, all answers might not be correct. It runs against the executequery endpoint, which does not allow deletes.

Some notes#

It relies on authentication with the azure.identity package, which can be installed with pip install azure-identity. Alternatively you can create the powerbi dataset with a token as a string without supplying the credentials.
You can also supply a username to impersonate for use with datasets that have RLS enabled.
The toolkit uses a LLM to create the query from the question, the agent uses the LLM for the overall execution.
Testing was done mostly with a text-davinci-003 model, codex models did not seem to perform ver well.

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/toolkits/examples/openapi.html,"OpenAPI agents#
We can construct agents to consume arbitrary APIs, here APIs conformant to the OpenAPI/Swagger specification.

1st example: hierarchical planning agent#
In this example, we’ll consider an approach called hierarchical planning, common in robotics and appearing in recent works for LLMs X robotics. We’ll see it’s a viable approach to start working with a massive API spec AND to assist with user queries that require multiple steps against the API.
The idea is simple: to get coherent agent behavior over long sequences behavior & to save on tokens, we’ll separate concerns: a “planner” will be responsible for what endpoints to call and a “controller” will be responsible for how to call them.
In the initial implementation, the planner is an LLM chain that has the name and a short description for each endpoint in context. The controller is an LLM agent that is instantiated with documentation for only the endpoints for a particular plan. There’s a lot left to get this working very robustly :)


To start, let’s collect some OpenAPI specs.#

We’ll work with the Spotify API as one of the examples of a somewhat complex API. There’s a bit of auth-related setup to do if you want to replicate this.

You’ll have to set up an application in the Spotify developer console, documented here, to get credentials: CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, and REDIRECT_URI.
To get an access tokens (and keep them fresh), you can implement the oauth flows, or you can use spotipy. If you’ve set your Spotify creedentials as environment variables SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID, SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET, and SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI, you can use the helper functions below:



import spotipy.util as util
from langchain.requests import RequestsWrapper

def construct_spotify_auth_headers(raw_spec: dict):
scopes = list(raw_spec['components']['securitySchemes']['oauth_2_0']['flows']['authorizationCode']['scopes'].keys())
access_token = util.prompt_for_user_token(scope=','.join(scopes))
return {
'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}'
}

# Get API credentials.
headers = construct_spotify_auth_headers(raw_spotify_api_spec)
requests_wrapper = RequestsWrapper(headers=headers)













How big is this spec?#


endpoints = [
(route, operation)
for route, operations in raw_spotify_api_spec[""paths""].items()
for operation in operations
if operation in [""get"", ""post""]
]
len(endpoints)











63













import tiktoken
enc = tiktoken.encoding_for_model('text-davinci-003')
def count_tokens(s): return len(enc.encode(s))

count_tokens(yaml.dump(raw_spotify_api_spec))











80326

2nd example: “json explorer” agent#
Here’s an agent that’s not particularly practical, but neat! The agent has access to 2 toolkits. One comprises tools to interact with json: one tool to list the keys of a json object and another tool to get the value for a given key. The other toolkit comprises requests wrappers to send GET and POST requests. This agent consumes a lot calls to the language model, but does a surprisingly decent job.

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/toolkits/examples/json.html,"JSON Agent#
This notebook showcases an agent designed to interact with large JSON/dict objects. This is useful when you want to answer questions about a JSON blob that’s too large to fit in the context window of an LLM. The agent is able to iteratively explore the blob to find what it needs to answer the user’s question.
In the below example, we are using the OpenAPI spec for the OpenAI API, which you can find here.
We will use the JSON agent to answer some questions about the API spec.

Currently There are four tools bundled in this toolkit:

AzureCogsImageAnalysisTool: used to extract caption, objects, tags, and text from images. (Note: this tool is not available on Mac OS yet, due to the dependency on azure-ai-vision package, which is only supported on Windows and Linux currently.)
AzureCogsFormRecognizerTool: used to extract text, tables, and key-value pairs from documents.
AzureCogsSpeech2TextTool: used to transcribe speech to text.
AzureCogsText2SpeechTool: used to synthesize text to speech.

First, you need to set up an Azure account and create a Cognitive Services resource. You can follow the instructions here to create a resource.
Then, you need to get the endpoint, key and region of your resource, and set them as environment variables. You can find them in the “Keys and Endpoint” page of your resource.

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/agents/custom_agent_with_tool_retrieval.html,"Custom Agent with Tool Retrieval#
This notebook builds off of this notebook and assumes familiarity with how agents work.
The novel idea introduced in this notebook is the idea of using retrieval to select the set of tools to use to answer an agent query. This is useful when you have many many tools to select from. You cannot put the description of all the tools in the prompt (because of context length issues) so instead you dynamically select the N tools you do want to consider using at run time.
In this notebook we will create a somewhat contrieved example. We will have one legitimate tool (search) and then 99 fake tools which are just nonsense. We will then add a step in the prompt template that takes the user input and retrieves tool relevant to the query.

Set up environment#
Do necessary imports, etc.

description=f""a silly function that you can use to get more information about the number {i}""
) 
for i in range(99)
]
ALL_TOOLS = [search_tool] + fake_tools













Tool Retriever#
We will use a vectorstore to create embeddings for each tool description. Then, for an incoming query we can create embeddings for that query and do a similarity search for relevant tools.


from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

docs = [Document(page_content=t.description, metadata={""index"": i}) for i, t in enumerate(ALL_TOOLS)]

retriever = vector_store.as_retriever()

def get_tools(query):

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/agents/custom_mrkl_agent.html,"Custom MRKL Agent#
This notebook goes through how to create your own custom MRKL agent.
A MRKL agent consists of three parts:
- Tools: The tools the agent has available to use.
- LLMChain: The LLMChain that produces the text that is parsed in a certain way to determine which action to take.
- The agent class itself: this parses the output of the LLMChain to determine which action to take.









In this notebook we walk through how to create a custom MRKL agent by creating a custom LLMChain.

Custom LLMChain#
The first way to create a custom agent is to use an existing Agent class, but use a custom LLMChain. This is the simplest way to create a custom Agent. It is highly recommended that you work with the ZeroShotAgent, as at the moment that is by far the most generalizable one.
Most of the work in creating the custom LLMChain comes down to the prompt. Because we are using an existing agent class to parse the output, it is very important that the prompt say to produce text in that format. Additionally, we currently require an agent_scratchpad input variable to put notes on previous actions and observations. This should almost always be the final part of the prompt. However, besides those instructions, you can customize the prompt as you wish.
To ensure that the prompt contains the appropriate instructions, we will utilize a helper method on that class. The helper method for the ZeroShotAgent takes the following arguments:

tools: List of tools the agent will have access to, used to format the prompt.
prefix: String to put before the list of tools.
suffix: String to put after the list of tools.
input_variables: List of input variables the final prompt will expect.

For this exercise, we will give our agent access to Google Search, and we will customize it in that we will have it answer as a pirate.


from langchain.agents import ZeroShotAgent, Tool, AgentExecutor
from langchain import OpenAI, SerpAPIWrapper, LLMChain













search = SerpAPIWrapper()
tools = [
Tool(
name = ""Search"",
func=search.run,
description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events""
)
]













prefix = """"""Answer the following questions as best you can, but speaking as a pirate might speak. You have access to the following tools:""""""
suffix = """"""Begin! Remember to speak as a pirate when giving your final answer. Use lots of ""Args""

Question: {input}
{agent_scratchpad}""""""

prompt = ZeroShotAgent.create_prompt(
tools, 
prefix=prefix, 
suffix=suffix, 
input_variables=[""input"", ""agent_scratchpad""]
)











In case we are curious, we can now take a look at the final prompt template to see what it looks like when its all put together.


print(prompt.template)











Answer the following questions as best you can, but speaking as a pirate might speak. You have access to the following tools:

Search: useful for when you need to answer questions about current events

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [Search]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Begin! Remember to speak as a pirate when giving your final answer. Use lots of ""Args""

Question: {input}
{agent_scratchpad}











Note that we are able to feed agents a self-defined prompt template, i.e. not restricted to the prompt generated by the create_prompt function, assuming it meets the agent’s requirements.
For example, for ZeroShotAgent, we will need to ensure that it meets the following requirements. There should a string starting with “Action:” and a following string starting with “Action Input:”, and both should be separated by a newline.


llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), prompt=prompt)













tool_names = [tool.name for tool in tools]
agent = ZeroShotAgent(llm_chain=llm_chain, allowed_tools=tool_names)













agent_executor = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)













agent_executor.run(""How many people live in canada as of 2023?"")

stop sequence: Instructs the LLM to stop generating as soon as this string is found

Passes user input and any previous steps to the Agent (in this case, the LLMAgent)
If the Agent returns an AgentFinish, then return that directly to the user
If the Agent returns an AgentAction, then use that to call a tool and get an Observation
Repeat, passing the AgentAction and Observation back to the Agent until an AgentFinish is emitted.

AgentAction is a response that consists of action and action_input. action refers to which tool to use, and action_input refers to the input to that tool. log can also be provided as more context (that can be used for logging, tracing, etc).
AgentFinish is a response that contains the final message to be sent back to the user. This should be used to end an agent run.

The output parser is responsible for parsing the LLM output into AgentAction and AgentFinish. This usually depends heavily on the prompt used.
This is where you can change the parsing to do retries, handle whitespace, etc


class CustomOutputParser(AgentOutputParser):

def parse(self, llm_output: str) -> Union[AgentAction, AgentFinish]:
# Check if agent should finish
if ""Final Answer:"" in llm_output:
return AgentFinish(
# Return values is generally always a dictionary with a single `output` key
# It is not recommended to try anything else at the moment :)
return_values={""output"": llm_output.split(""Final Answer:"")[-1].strip()},
log=llm_output,
)
# Parse out the action and action input
regex = r""Action\s*\d*\s*:(.*?)\nAction\s*\d*\s*Input\s*\d*\s*:[\s]*(.*)""
match = re.search(regex, llm_output, re.DOTALL)
if not match:
raise ValueError(f""Could not parse LLM output: `{llm_output}`"")
action = match.group(1).strip()
action_input = match.group(2)
# Return the action and action input
return AgentAction(tool=action, tool_input=action_input.strip("" "").strip('""'), log=llm_output)













output_parser = CustomOutputParser()













Set up LLM#
Choose the LLM you want to use!


llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)













Define the stop sequence#
This is important because it tells the LLM when to stop generation.
This depends heavily on the prompt and model you are using. Generally, you want this to be whatever token you use in the prompt to denote the start of an Observation (otherwise, the LLM may hallucinate an observation for you).


Set up the Agent#
We can now combine everything to set up our agent


# LLM chain consisting of the LLM and a prompt
llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)













tool_names = [tool.name for tool in tools]
agent = LLMSingleActionAgent(
llm_chain=llm_chain, 
output_parser=output_parser,
stop=[""\nObservation:""], 
allowed_tools=tool_names
)













Use the Agent#
Now we can use it!


agent_executor = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)













agent_executor.run(""How many people live in canada as of 2023?"")

"
,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/agents/agent_types.html,"Agent Types#
Agents use an LLM to determine which actions to take and in what order.
An action can either be using a tool and observing its output, or returning a response to the user.
Here are the agents available in LangChain.

zero-shot-react-description#
This agent uses the ReAct framework to determine which tool to use
based solely on the tool’s description. Any number of tools can be provided.
This agent requires that a description is provided for each tool.


react-docstore#
This agent uses the ReAct framework to interact with a docstore. Two tools must
be provided: a Search tool and a Lookup tool (they must be named exactly as so).
The Search tool should search for a document, while the Lookup tool should lookup
a term in the most recently found document.
This agent is equivalent to the
original ReAct paper, specifically the Wikipedia example.


self-ask-with-search#
This agent utilizes a single tool that should be named Intermediate Answer.
This tool should be able to lookup factual answers to questions. This agent
is equivalent to the original self ask with search paper,
where a Google search API was provided as the tool.

conversational-react-description#
This agent is designed to be used in conversational settings.
The prompt is designed to make the agent helpful and conversational.
It uses the ReAct framework to decide which tool to use, and uses memory to remember the previous conversation interactions."

Full docs here: https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/docs
Zapier Natural Language Actions gives you access to the 5k+ apps, 20k+ actions on Zapier’s platform through a natural language API interface.
NLA supports apps like Gmail, Salesforce, Trello, Slack, Asana, HubSpot, Google Sheets, Microsoft Teams, and thousands more apps: https://zapier.com/apps
Zapier NLA handles ALL the underlying API auth and translation from natural language –> underlying API call –> return simplified output for LLMs. The key idea is you, or your users, expose a set of actions via an oauth-like setup window, which you can then query and execute via a REST API.
NLA offers both API Key and OAuth for signing NLA API requests.

Server-side (API Key): for quickly getting started, testing, and production scenarios where LangChain will only use actions exposed in the developer’s Zapier account (and will use the developer’s connected accounts on Zapier.com)
User-facing (Oauth): for production scenarios where you are deploying an end-user facing application and LangChain needs access to end-user’s exposed actions and connected accounts on Zapier.com

This quick start will focus on the server-side use case for brevity. Review full docs or reach out to nla@zapier.com for user-facing oauth developer support.
This example goes over how to use the Zapier integration with a SimpleSequentialChain, then an Agent.
In code, below:


import os

# get from https://platform.openai.com/
os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = os.environ.get(""OPENAI_API_KEY"", """")

# get from https://nla.zapier.com/demo/provider/debug (under User Information, after logging in):

'Page: Hunter × Hunter\nSummary: Hunter × Hunter (stylized as HUNTER×HUNTER and pronounced ""hunter hunter"") is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi. It has been serialized in Shueisha\'s shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since March 1998, although the manga has frequently gone on extended hiatuses since 2006. Its chapters have been collected in 37 tankōbon volumes as of November 2022. The story focuses on a young boy named Gon Freecss who discovers that his father, who left him at a young age, is actually a world-renowned Hunter, a licensed professional who specializes in fantastical pursuits such as locating rare or unidentified animal species, treasure hunting, surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting down lawless individuals. Gon departs on a journey to become a Hunter and eventually find his father. Along the way, Gon meets various other Hunters and encounters the paranormal.\nHunter × Hunter was adapted into a 62-episode anime television series produced by Nippon Animation and directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi, which ran on Fuji Television from October 1999 to March 2001. Three separate original video animations (OVAs) totaling 30 episodes were subsequently produced by Nippon Animation and released in Japan from 2002 to 2004. A second anime television series by Madhouse aired on Nippon Television from October 2011 to September 2014, totaling 148 episodes, with two animated theatrical films released in 2013. There are also numerous audio albums, video games, musicals, and other media based on Hunter × Hunter.\nThe manga has been translated into English and released in North America by Viz Media since April 2005. Both television series have been also licensed by Viz Media, with the first series having aired on the Funimation Channel in 2009 and the second series broadcast on Adult Swim\'s Toonami programming block from April 2016 to June 2019.\nHunter × Hunter has been a huge critical and financial success and has become one of the best-selling manga series of all time, having over 84 million copies in circulation by July 2022.\n\nPage: Hunter × Hunter (2011 TV series)\nSummary: Hunter × Hunter is an anime television series that aired from 2011 to 2014 based on Yoshihiro Togashi\'s manga series Hunter × Hunter. The story begins with a young boy named Gon Freecss, who one day discovers that the father who he thought was dead, is in fact alive and well. He learns that his father, Ging, is a legendary ""Hunter"", an individual who has proven themselves an elite member of humanity. Despite the fact that Ging left his son with his relatives in order to pursue his own dreams, Gon becomes determined to follow in his father\'s footsteps, pass the rigorous ""Hunter Examination"", and eventually find his father to become a Hunter in his own right.\nThis new Hunter × Hunter anime was announced on July 24, 2011. It is a complete reboot of the anime adaptation starting from the beginning of the manga, with no connections to the first anime from 1999. Produced by Nippon TV, VAP, Shueisha and Madhouse, the series is directed by Hiroshi Kōjina, with Atsushi Maekawa and Tsutomu Kamishiro handling series composition, Takahiro Yoshimatsu designing the characters and Yoshihisa Hirano composing the music. Instead of having the old cast reprise their roles for the new adaptation, the series features an entirely new cast to voice the characters. The new series premiered airing weekly on Nippon TV and the nationwide Nippon News Network from October 2, 2011.The series started to be collected in both DVD and Blu-ray format on January 25, 2012. Viz Media has licensed the anime for a DVD/Blu-ray release in North America with an English dub. On television, the series began airing on Adult Swim\'s Toonami programming block on April 17, 2016, and ended on June 23, 2019.The anime series\' opening theme is alternated between the song ""Departure!"" and an alternate version titled ""Departure! -Second Version-"" both sung by Galneryus\' vocalist Masatoshi Ono. Five pieces of music were used as the ending theme; ""Just Awake"" by the Japanese band Fear, and Loathing in Las Vegas in episodes 1 to 26, ""Hunting for Your Dream"" by Galneryus in episodes 27 to 58, ""Reason"" sung by Japanese duo Yuzu in episodes 59 to 75, ""Nagareboshi Kirari"" also sung by Yuzu from episode 76 to 98, which was originally from the anime film adaptation, Hunter × Hunter: Phantom Rouge, and ""Hyōri Ittai"" by Yuzu featuring Hyadain from episode 99 to 146, which was also used in the film Hunter × Hunter: The Last Mission. The background music and soundtrack for the series was composed by Yoshihisa Hirano.\n\n\n\nPage: List of Hunter × Hunter characters\nSummary: The Hunter × Hunter manga series, created by Yoshihiro Togashi, features an extensive cast of characters. It takes place in a fictional universe where licensed specialists known as Hunters travel the world taking on special jobs ranging from treasure hunting to assassination. The story initially focuses on Gon Freecss and his quest to become a Hunter in order to find his father, Ging, who is himself a famous Hunter. On the way, Gon meets and becomes close friends with Killua Zoldyck, Kurapika and Leorio Paradinight.\nAlthough most characters are human, most possess superhuman strength and/or supernatural abilities due to Nen, the ability to control one\'s own life energy or aura. The world of the series also includes fantastical beasts such as the Chimera Ants or the Five great calamities.'

'Large language models (LLMs) represent a major advancement in AI, with the promise of transforming domains through learned knowledge. LLM sizes have been increasing 10X every year for the last few years, and as these models grow in complexity and size, so do their capabilities.\n\nGPT-3 can translate language, write essays, generate computer code, and more — all with limited to no supervision. In July 2020, OpenAI unveiled GPT-3, a language model that was easily the largest known at the time. Put simply, GPT-3 is trained to predict the next word in a sentence, much like how a text message autocomplete feature works.\n\nA large language model, or LLM, is a deep learning algorithm that can recognize, summarize, translate, predict and generate text and other content based on knowledge gained from massive datasets. Large language models are among the most successful applications of transformer models.\n\nAll of today’s well-known language models—e.g., GPT-3 from OpenAI, PaLM or LaMDA from Google, Galactica or OPT from Meta, Megatron-Turing from Nvidia/Microsoft, Jurassic-1 from AI21 Labs—are...\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3are increasingly being used to generate text.

Usage in an Agent#
The tool can be used in any LangChain agent as follows:


from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"")
agent = initialize_agent(
tools, llm, memory=memory, agent=""conversational-react-description"", verbose=True
)
output = agent.run(
input=(
""What is in this image https://storage.googleapis.com/causal-diffusion.appspot.com/imagePrompts%2F0rw369i5h9t%2Foriginal.png. ""
""Is it movie or a game? If it is a movie, what is the name of the movie?""
)
)

Observation: In a charmingly whimsical scene, a young girl is seen braving the rain alongside her furry companion, the lovable Totoro. The two are depicted standing on a bustling street corner, where they are sheltered from the rain by a bright yellow umbrella. The girl, dressed in a cheerful yellow frock, holds onto the umbrella with both hands while gazing up at Totoro with an expression of wonder and delight.

Totoro, meanwhile, stands tall and proud beside his young friend, holding his own umbrella aloft to protect them both from the downpour. His furry body is rendered in rich shades of grey and white, while his large ears and wide eyes lend him an endearing charm.

In the background of the scene, a street sign can be seen jutting out from the pavement amidst a flurry of raindrops. A sign with Chinese characters adorns its surface, adding to the sense of cultural diversity and intrigue. Despite the dreary weather, there is an undeniable sense of joy and camaraderie in this heartwarming image.

This notebook shows how to use IFTTT Webhooks.
From https://github.com/SidU/teams-langchain-js/wiki/Connecting-IFTTT-Services.

Creating a webhook#

Go to https://ifttt.com/create



Configuring the “If This”#

Click on the “If This” button in the IFTTT interface.
Search for “Webhooks” in the search bar.
Choose the first option for “Receive a web request with a JSON payload.”
Choose an Event Name that is specific to the service you plan to connect to.
This will make it easier for you to manage the webhook URL.
For example, if you’re connecting to Spotify, you could use “Spotify” as your
Event Name.
Click the “Create Trigger” button to save your settings and create your webhook.



Configuring the “Then That”#

Tap on the “Then That” button in the IFTTT interface.
Search for the service you want to connect, such as Spotify.
Choose an action from the service, such as “Add track to a playlist”.
Configure the action by specifying the necessary details, such as the playlist name,
e.g., “Songs from AI”.
Reference the JSON Payload received by the Webhook in your action. For the Spotify
scenario, choose “{{JsonPayload}}” as your search query.
Tap the “Create Action” button to save your action settings.
Once you have finished configuring your action, click the “Finish” button to
complete the setup.
Congratulations! You have successfully connected the Webhook to the desired
service, and you’re ready to start receiving data and triggering actions 🎉



Finishing up#

To get your webhook URL go to https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks/settings
Copy the IFTTT key value from there. The URL is of the form
https://maker.ifttt.com/use/YOUR_IFTTT_KEY. Grab the YOUR_IFTTT_KEY value.

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/tools/examples/graphql.html,"GraphQL tool#
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to use the BaseGraphQLTool component with an Agent.
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries against your data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
By including a BaseGraphQLTool in the list of tools provided to an Agent, you can grant your Agent the ability to query data from GraphQL APIs for any purposes you need.
In this example, we’ll be using the public Star Wars GraphQL API available at the following endpoint: https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/index.
First, you need to install httpx and gql Python packages.


pip install httpx gql > /dev/null











Now, let’s create a BaseGraphQLTool instance with the specified Star Wars API endpoint and initialize an Agent with the tool.


from langchain import OpenAI
from langchain.agents import load_tools, initialize_agent, AgentType
from langchain.utilities import GraphQLAPIWrapper

agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)











Now, we can use the Agent to run queries against the Star Wars GraphQL API. Let’s ask the Agent to list all the Star Wars films and their release dates.


graphql_fields = """"""allFilms {
films {
title
director
releaseDate
speciesConnection {
species {
name
classification
homeworld {

There are many 1000s of Gradio apps on Hugging Face Spaces. This library puts them at the tips of your LLM’s fingers 🦾
Specifically, gradio-tools is a Python library for converting Gradio apps into tools that can be leveraged by a large language model (LLM)-based agent to complete its task. For example, an LLM could use a Gradio tool to transcribe a voice recording it finds online and then summarize it for you. Or it could use a different Gradio tool to apply OCR to a document on your Google Drive and then answer questions about it.
It’s very easy to create you own tool if you want to use a space that’s not one of the pre-built tools. Please see this section of the gradio-tools documentation for information on how to do that. All contributions are welcome!

First, you need to set up the proper API keys and environment variables. To set it up, create the GOOGLE_API_KEY in the Google Cloud credential console (https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and a GOOGLE_CSE_ID using the Programmable Search Enginge (https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/create). Next, it is good to follow the instructions found here.

LangChain provides tools for interacting with a local file system out of the box. This notebook walks through some of them.
Note: these tools are not recommended for use outside a sandboxed environment!
First, we’ll import the tools.


from langchain.tools.file_management import (
ReadFileTool,
CopyFileTool,
DeleteFileTool,
MoveFileTool,
WriteFileTool,
ListDirectoryTool,
)
from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import FileManagementToolkit
from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory

# We'll make a temporary directory to avoid clutter
working_directory = TemporaryDirectory()












The FileManagementToolkit#
If you want to provide all the file tooling to your agent, it’s easy to do so with the toolkit. We’ll pass the temporary directory in as a root directory as a workspace for the LLM.
It’s recommended to always pass in a root directory, since without one, it’s easy for the LLM to pollute the working directory, and without one, there isn’t any validation against
straightforward prompt injection.


toolkit = FileManagementToolkit(root_dir=str(working_directory.name)) # If you don't provide a root_dir, operations will default to the current working directory
toolkit.get_tools()











[CopyFileTool(name='copy_file', description='Create a copy of a file in a specified location', args_schema=<class 'langchain.tools.file_management.copy.FileCopyInput'>, return_direct=False, verbose=False, callback_manager=<langchain.callbacks.shared.SharedCallbackManager object at 0x1156f4350>, root_dir='/var/folders/gf/6rnp_mbx5914kx7qmmh7xzmw0000gn/T/tmpxb8c3aug'),

Selecting File System Tools#
If you only want to select certain tools, you can pass them in as arguments when initializing the toolkit, or you can individually initialize the desired tools.

This notebook goes over how to use the AWS Lambda Tool component.
AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), designed to allow developers to build and run applications and services without the need for provisioning or managing servers. This serverless architecture enables you to focus on writing and deploying code, while AWS automatically takes care of scaling, patching, and managing the infrastructure required to run your applications.
By including a awslambda in the list of tools provided to an Agent, you can grant your Agent the ability to invoke code running in your AWS Cloud for whatever purposes you need.
When an Agent uses the awslambda tool, it will provide an argument of type string which will in turn be passed into the Lambda function via the event parameter.
First, you need to install boto3 python package.


!pip install boto3 > /dev/null











In order for an agent to use the tool, you must provide it with the name and description that match the functionality of you lambda function’s logic.
You must also provide the name of your function.
Note that because this tool is effectively just a wrapper around the boto3 library, you will need to run aws configure in order to make use of the tool. For more detail, see here

Title: Heat-bath random walks with Markov bases
Authors: Caprice Stanley, Tobias Windisch
Summary: Graphs on lattice points are studied whose edges come from a finite set of
allowed moves of arbitrary length. We show that the diameter of these graphs on
fibers of a fixed integer matrix can be bounded from above by a constant. We
then study the mixing behaviour of heat-bath random walks on these graphs. We
also state explicit conditions on the set of moves so that the heat-bath random
walk, a generalization of the Glauber dynamics, is an expander in fixed
dimension.
Thought:The paper is about heat-bath random walks with Markov bases on graphs of lattice points.

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/tools/examples/apify.html,"Apify#
This notebook shows how to use the Apify integration for LangChain.
Apify is a cloud platform for web scraping and data extraction,
which provides an ecosystem of more than a thousand
ready-made apps called Actors for various web scraping, crawling, and data extraction use cases.
For example, you can use it to extract Google Search results, Instagram and Facebook profiles, products from Amazon or Shopify, Google Maps reviews, etc. etc.
In this example, we’ll use the Website Content Crawler Actor,
which can deeply crawl websites such as documentation, knowledge bases, help centers, or blogs,
and extract text content from the web pages. Then we feed the documents into a vector index and answer questions from it.


#!pip install apify-client











First, import ApifyWrapper into your source code:


from langchain.document_loaders.base import Document
from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator
from langchain.utilities import ApifyWrapper











Initialize it using your Apify API token and for the purpose of this example, also with your OpenAI API key:


import os
os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = ""Your OpenAI API key""
os.environ[""APIFY_API_TOKEN""] = ""Your Apify API token""

apify = ApifyWrapper()











Then run the Actor, wait for it to finish, and fetch its results from the Apify dataset into a LangChain document loader.
Note that if you already have some results in an Apify dataset, you can load them directly using ApifyDatasetLoader, as shown in this notebook. In that notebook, you’ll also find the explanation of the dataset_mapping_function, which is used to map fields from the Apify dataset records to LangChain Document fields.


loader = apify.call_actor(
actor_id=""apify/website-content-crawler"",
run_input={""startUrls"": [{""url"": ""https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/""}]},
dataset_mapping_function=lambda item: Document(
page_content=item[""text""] or """", metadata={""source"": item[""url""]}
),
)











Initialize the vector index from the crawled documents:


index = VectorstoreIndexCreator().from_loaders([loader])











And finally, query the vector index:


query = ""What is LangChain?""
result = index.query_with_sources(query)













print(result[""answer""])
print(result[""sources""])











 LangChain is a standard interface through which you can interact with a variety of large language models (LLMs). It provides modules that can be used to build language model applications, and it also provides chains and agents with memory capabilities.

Multi-Input Tools with a string format#
An alternative to the structured tool would be to use the regular Tool class and accept a single string. The tool would then have to handle the parsing logic to extract the relavent values from the text, which tightly couples the tool representation to the agent prompt. This is still useful if the underlying language model can’t reliabl generate structured schema.
Let’s take the multiplication function as an example. In order to use this, we will tell the agent to generate the “Action Input” as a comma-separated list of length two. We will then write a thin wrapper that takes a string, splits it into two around a comma, and passes both parsed sides as integers to the multiplication function.


from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool
from langchain.agents import AgentType











Here is the multiplication function, as well as a wrapper to parse a string as input.


def multiplier(a, b):
return a * b

def parsing_multiplier(string):
a, b = string.split("","")
return multiplier(int(a), int(b))

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/tools/custom_tools.html,"Defining Custom Tools#
When constructing your own agent, you will need to provide it with a list of Tools that it can use. Besides the actual function that is called, the Tool consists of several components:

name (str), is required and must be unique within a set of tools provided to an agent
description (str), is optional but recommended, as it is used by an agent to determine tool use
return_direct (bool), defaults to False
args_schema (Pydantic BaseModel), is optional but recommended, can be used to provide more information (e.g., few-shot examples) or validation for expected parameters.

There are two main ways to define a tool, we will cover both in the example below.


# Import things that are needed generically
from langchain import LLMMathChain, SerpAPIWrapper
from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.tools import BaseTool, StructuredTool, Tool, tool











Initialize the LLM to use for the agent.


llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)












Completely New Tools - String Input and Output#
The simplest tools accept a single query string and return a string output. If your tool function requires multiple arguments, you might want to skip down to the StructuredTool section below.
There are two ways to do this: either by using the Tool dataclass, or by subclassing the BaseTool class.

Tool dataclass#
The ‘Tool’ dataclass wraps functions that accept a single string input and returns a string output.


# Load the tool configs that are needed.
search = SerpAPIWrapper()
llm_math_chain = LLMMathChain(llm=llm, verbose=True)
tools = [
Tool.from_function(
func=search.run,
name = ""Search"",
description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events""
# coroutine= ... <- you can specify an async method if desired as well
),
]











/Users/wfh/code/lc/lckg/langchain/chains/llm_math/base.py:50: UserWarning: Directly instantiating an LLMMathChain with an llm is deprecated. Please instantiate with llm_chain argument or using the from_llm class method.
warnings.warn(











You can also define a custom `args_schema`` to provide more information about inputs.


from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class CalculatorInput(BaseModel):
question: str = Field()


tools.append(
Tool.from_function(
func=llm_math_chain.run,
name=""Calculator"",
description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about math"",
args_schema=CalculatorInput
# coroutine= ... <- you can specify an async method if desired as well
)
)













# Construct the agent. We will use the default agent type here.
# See documentation for a full list of options.
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)

""Camila Morrone's current age raised to the 0.43 power is approximately 3.99.""













Subclassing the BaseTool class#
You can also directly subclass BaseTool. This is useful if you want more control over the instance variables or if you want to propagate callbacks to nested chains or other tools.

Using the tool decorator#
To make it easier to define custom tools, a @tool decorator is provided. This decorator can be used to quickly create a Tool from a simple function. The decorator uses the function name as the tool name by default, but this can be overridden by passing a string as the first argument. Additionally, the decorator will use the function’s docstring as the tool’s description.


from langchain.tools import tool

@tool
def search_api(query: str) -> str:
""""""Searches the API for the query.""""""
return f""Results for query {query}""

search_api











You can also provide arguments like the tool name and whether to return directly.


@tool(""search"", return_direct=True)
def search_api(query: str) -> str:
""""""Searches the API for the query.""""""
return ""Results""













search_api











Tool(name='search', description='search(query: str) -> str - Searches the API for the query.', args_schema=<class 'pydantic.main.SearchApi'>, return_direct=True, verbose=False, callback_manager=<langchain.callbacks.shared.SharedCallbackManager object at 0x12748c4c0>, func=<function search_api at 0x16bd66310>, coroutine=None)











You can also provide args_schema to provide more information about the argument


class SearchInput(BaseModel):
query: str = Field(description=""should be a search query"")

@tool(""search"", return_direct=True, args_schema=SearchInput)
def search_api(query: str) -> str:
""""""Searches the API for the query.""""""
return ""Results""













search_api











Tool(name='search', description='search(query: str) -> str - Searches the API for the query.', args_schema=<class '__main__.SearchInput'>, return_direct=True, verbose=False, callback_manager=<langchain.callbacks.shared.SharedCallbackManager object at 0x12748c4c0>, func=<function search_api at 0x16bcf0ee0>, coroutine=None)













Custom Structured Tools#
If your functions require more structured arguments, you can use the StructuredTool class directly, or still subclass the BaseTool class.

StructuredTool dataclass#
To dynamically generate a structured tool from a given function, the fastest way to get started is with StructuredTool.from_function().


import requests
from langchain.tools import StructuredTool

def post_message(url: str, body: dict, parameters: Optional[dict] = None) -> str:
""""""Sends a POST request to the given url with the given body and parameters.""""""
result = requests.post(url, json=body, params=parameters)
return f""Status: {result.status_code} - {result.text}""

tool = StructuredTool.from_function(post_message)














Subclassing the BaseTool#
The BaseTool automatically infers the schema from the _run method’s signature.


from typing import Optional, Type

from langchain.callbacks.manager import AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun, CallbackManagerForToolRun

class CustomSearchTool(BaseTool):
name = ""custom_search""
description = ""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events""

def _run(self, query: str, engine: str = ""google"", gl: str = ""us"", hl: str = ""en"", run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForToolRun] = None) -> str:
""""""Use the tool.""""""
search_wrapper = SerpAPIWrapper(params={""engine"": engine, ""gl"": gl, ""hl"": hl})
return search_wrapper.run(query)

async def _arun(self, query: str,engine: str = ""google"", gl: str = ""us"", hl: str = ""en"", run_manager: Optional[AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun] = None) -> str:
""""""Use the tool asynchronously.""""""
raise NotImplementedError(""custom_search does not support async"")



# You can provide a custom args schema to add descriptions or custom validation

class SearchSchema(BaseModel):
query: str = Field(description=""should be a search query"")
engine: str = Field(description=""should be a search engine"")
gl: str = Field(description=""should be a country code"")
hl: str = Field(description=""should be a language code"")

class CustomSearchTool(BaseTool):
name = ""custom_search""
description = ""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events""
args_schema: Type[SearchSchema] = SearchSchema

def _run(self, query: str, engine: str = ""google"", gl: str = ""us"", hl: str = ""en"", run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForToolRun] = None) -> str:
""""""Use the tool.""""""
search_wrapper = SerpAPIWrapper(params={""engine"": engine, ""gl"": gl, ""hl"": hl})
return search_wrapper.run(query)

async def _arun(self, query: str,engine: str = ""google"", gl: str = ""us"", hl: str = ""en"", run_manager: Optional[AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun] = None) -> str:
""""""Use the tool asynchronously.""""""
raise NotImplementedError(""custom_search does not support async"")















Using the decorator#
The tool decorator creates a structured tool automatically if the signature has multiple arguments.


import requests
from langchain.tools import tool

@tool
def post_message(url: str, body: dict, parameters: Optional[dict] = None) -> str:
""""""Sends a POST request to the given url with the given body and parameters.""""""
result = requests.post(url, json=body, params=parameters)
return f""Status: {result.status_code} - {result.text}""













Modify existing tools#
Now, we show how to load existing tools and modify them directly. In the example below, we do something really simple and change the Search tool to have the name Google Search.


from langchain.agents import load_tools













tools = load_tools([""serpapi"", ""llm-math""], llm=llm)













tools[0].name = ""Google Search""













agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)













agent.run(""Who is Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend? What is her current age raised to the 0.43 power?"")











> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
I need to find out Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend's name and her age.
Action: Google Search
Action Input: ""Leo DiCaprio girlfriend""
Observation: After rumours of a romance with Gigi Hadid, the Oscar winner has seemingly moved on. First being linked to the television personality in September 2022, it appears as if his ""age bracket"" has moved up. This follows his rumoured relationship with mere 19-year-old Eden Polani.
Thought:I still need to find out his current girlfriend's name and her age.
Action: Google Search
Action Input: ""Leo DiCaprio current girlfriend age""
Observation: Leonardo DiCaprio has been linked with 19-year-old model Eden Polani, continuing the rumour that he doesn't date any women over the age of ...
Thought:I need to find out the age of Eden Polani.
Action: Calculator
Action Input: 19^(0.43)
Observation: Answer: 3.547023357958959
Thought:I now know the final answer.
Final Answer: The age of Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend raised to the 0.43 power is approximately 3.55.

> Finished chain.









""The age of Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend raised to the 0.43 power is approximately 3.55.""













Defining the priorities among Tools#
When you made a Custom tool, you may want the Agent to use the custom tool more than normal tools.
For example, you made a custom tool, which gets information on music from your database. When a user wants information on songs, You want the Agent to usethe custom tool more than the normal Search tool. But the Agent might prioritize a normal Search tool.
This can be accomplished by adding a statement such as Use this more than the normal search if the question is about Music, like 'who is the singer of yesterday?' or 'what is the most popular song in 2022?' to the description.
An example is below.


# Import things that are needed generically
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool
from langchain.agents import AgentType
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain import LLMMathChain, SerpAPIWrapper
search = SerpAPIWrapper()
tools = [
Tool(
name = ""Search"",
func=search.run,
description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events""
),
Tool(
name=""Music Search"",
func=lambda x: ""'All I Want For Christmas Is You' by Mariah Carey."", #Mock Function
description=""A Music search engine. Use this more than the normal search if the question is about Music, like 'who is the singer of yesterday?' or 'what is the most popular song in 2022?'"",
)
]

agent = initialize_agent(tools, OpenAI(temperature=0), agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)













agent.run(""what is the most famous song of christmas"")











> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
 I should use a music search engine to find the answer
Action: Music Search
Action Input: most famous song of christmas'All I Want For Christmas Is You' by Mariah Carey. I now know the final answer
Final Answer: 'All I Want For Christmas Is You' by Mariah Carey.

> Finished chain.









""'All I Want For Christmas Is You' by Mariah Carey.""













Using tools to return directly#
Often, it can be desirable to have a tool output returned directly to the user, if it’s called. You can do this easily with LangChain by setting the return_direct flag for a tool to be True.


llm_math_chain = LLMMathChain(llm=llm)
tools = [
Tool(
name=""Calculator"",
func=llm_math_chain.run,
description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about math"",
return_direct=True
)
]













llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)













agent.run(""whats 2**.12"")











> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
 I need to calculate this
Action: Calculator
Action Input: 2**.12Answer: 1.086734862526058

> Finished chain.









'Answer: 1.086734862526058'













Handling Tool Errors#
When a tool encounters an error and the exception is not caught, the agent will stop executing. If you want the agent to continue execution, you can raise a ToolException and set handle_tool_error accordingly.
When ToolException is thrown, the agent will not stop working, but will handle the exception according to the handle_tool_error variable of the tool, and the processing result will be returned to the agent as observation, and printed in red.
You can set handle_tool_error to True, set it a unified string value, or set it as a function. If it’s set as a function, the function should take a ToolException as a parameter and return a str value.
Please note that only raising a ToolException won’t be effective. You need to first set the handle_tool_error of the tool because its default value is False.


from langchain.schema import ToolException

from langchain import SerpAPIWrapper
from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.tools import Tool

from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

def _handle_error(error:ToolException) -> str:
return""The following errors occurred during tool execution:"" + error.args[0]+ ""Please try another tool.""
def search_tool1(s: str):raise ToolException(""The search tool1 is not available."")
def search_tool2(s: str):raise ToolException(""The search tool2 is not available."")
search_tool3 = SerpAPIWrapper()

Agents use an LLM to determine which actions to take and in what order.
An action can either be using a tool and observing its output, or returning to the user.
When used correctly agents can be extremely powerful. The purpose of this notebook is to show you how to easily use agents through the simplest, highest level API.
In order to load agents, you should understand the following concepts:

Tool: A function that performs a specific duty. This can be things like: Google Search, Database lookup, Python REPL, other chains. The interface for a tool is currently a function that is expected to have a string as an input, with a string as an output.
LLM: The language model powering the agent.
Agent: The agent to use. This should be a string that references a support agent class. Because this notebook focuses on the simplest, highest level API, this only covers using the standard supported agents. If you want to implement a custom agent, see the documentation for custom agents.

Agents: For a list of supported agents and their specifications, see here.
Tools: For a list of predefined tools and their specifications, see here.


from langchain.agents import load_tools
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
from langchain.agents import AgentType
from langchain.llms import OpenAI











First, let’s load the language model we’re going to use to control the agent.


llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)











Next, let’s load some tools to use. Note that the llm-math tool uses an LLM, so we need to pass that in.


tools = load_tools([""serpapi"", ""llm-math""], llm=llm)











Finally, let’s initialize an agent with the tools, the language model, and the type of agent we want to use.


agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)











Now let’s test it out!


agent.run(""Who is Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend? What is her current age raised to the 0.43 power?"")











> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
 I need to find out who Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend is and then calculate her age raised to the 0.43 power.
Action: Search
Action Input: ""Leo DiCaprio girlfriend""
Observation: Camila Morrone
Thought: I need to find out Camila Morrone's age
Action: Search
Action Input: ""Camila Morrone age""

Note
Conceptual Guide

Some applications require not just a predetermined chain of calls to LLMs/other tools,
but potentially an unknown chain that depends on the user’s input.
In these types of chains, there is an agent which has access to a suite of tools.
Depending on the user input, the agent can then decide which, if any, of these tools to call.
At the moment, there are two main types of agents:

Action Agents: these agents decide the actions to take and execute that actions one action at a time.
Plan-and-Execute Agents: these agents first decide a plan of actions to take, and then execute those actions one at a time.

When should you use each one? Action Agents are more conventional, and good for small tasks.
For more complex or long running tasks, the initial planning step helps to maintain long term objectives and focus.
However, that comes at the expense of generally more calls and higher latency.
These two agents are also not mutually exclusive - in fact, it is often best to have an Action Agent be in charge
of the execution for the Plan and Execute agent.

Action Agents#
High level pseudocode of the Action Agents:

The user input is received
The agent decides which tool - if any - to use, and what the tool input should be
That tool is then called with the tool input, and an observation is recorded (the output of this calling)
That history of tool, tool input, and observation is passed back into the agent, and it decides the next step
This is repeated until the agent decides it no longer needs to use a tool, and then it responds directly to the user.

The different abstractions involved in agents are:

Agent: this is where the logic of the application lives. Agents expose an interface that takes in user input
along with a list of previous steps the agent has taken, and returns either an AgentAction or AgentFinish

AgentAction corresponds to the tool to use and the input to that tool
AgentFinish means the agent is done, and has information around what to return to the user


Tools: these are the actions an agent can take. What tools you give an agent highly depend on what you want the agent to do
Toolkits: these are groups of tools designed for a specific use case. For example, in order for an agent to
interact with a SQL database in the best way it may need access to one tool to execute queries and another tool to inspect tables.
Agent Executor: this wraps an agent and a list of tools. This is responsible for the loop of running the agent
iteratively until the stopping criteria is met.






Getting Started: An overview of agents. It covers how to use all things related to agents in an end-to-end manner.





Agent Construction:
Although an agent can be constructed in many way, the typical way to construct an agent is with:

PromptTemplate: this is responsible for taking the user input and previous steps and constructing a prompt
to send to the language model
Language Model: this takes the prompt constructed by the PromptTemplate and returns some output
Output Parser: this takes the output of the Language Model and parses it into an AgentAction or AgentFinish object.





Additional Documentation:

Tools: Different types of tools LangChain supports natively. We also cover how to add your own tools.
Agents: Different types of agents LangChain supports natively. We also cover how to
modify and create your own agents.
Toolkits: Various toolkits that LangChain supports out of the box, and how to
create an agent from them.
Agent Executor: The Agent Executor class, which is responsible for calling
the agent and tools in a loop. We go over different ways to customize this, and options you can use for more control.



Plan-and-Execute Agents#
High level pseudocode of the Plan-and-Execute Agents:

The user input is received
The planner lists out the steps to take
The executor goes through the list of steps, executing them

The most typical implementation is to have the planner be a language model, and the executor be an action agent.

Load the spec#
Load a wrapper of the spec (so we can work with it more easily). You can load from a url or from a local file.


spec = OpenAPISpec.from_url(""https://www.klarna.com/us/shopping/public/openai/v0/api-docs/"")











Attempting to load an OpenAPI 3.0.1 spec.This may result in degraded performance. Convert your OpenAPI spec to 3.1.* spec for better support.













# Alternative loading from file
# spec = OpenAPISpec.from_file(""openai_openapi.yaml"")













Select the Operation#
In order to provide a focused on modular chain, we create a chain specifically only for one of the endpoints. Here we get an API operation from a specified endpoint and method.


operation = APIOperation.from_openapi_spec(spec, '/public/openai/v0/products', ""get"")













Construct the chain#
We can now construct a chain to interact with it. In order to construct such a chain, we will pass in:

Black body radiation is the emission of electromagnetic radiation from a body due to its temperature. It is a type of thermal radiation that is emitted from the surface of all objects that are at a temperature above absolute zero. It is a spectrum of radiation that is influenced by the temperature of the body and is independent of the composition of the emitting material.

?

The first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3 is 43. To solve this problem, we can break down the question into two parts: finding the first prime number greater than 40, and then finding a number that is divisible by 3. 

The first step is to find the first prime number greater than 40. A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself. The next prime number after 40 is 41.

The second step is to find a number that is divisible by 3. To do this, we can add 1 to 41, which gives us 42. Now, we can check if 42 is divisible by 3. 42 divided by 3 is 14, so 42 is divisible by 3.

Therefore, the answer to the question is 43.

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/examples/moderation.html,"Moderation#
This notebook walks through examples of how to use a moderation chain, and several common ways for doing so. Moderation chains are useful for detecting text that could be hateful, violent, etc. This can be useful to apply on both user input, but also on the output of a Language Model. Some API providers, like OpenAI, specifically prohibit you, or your end users, from generating some types of harmful content. To comply with this (and to just generally prevent your application from being harmful) you may often want to append a moderation chain to any LLMChains, in order to make sure any output the LLM generates is not harmful.
If the content passed into the moderation chain is harmful, there is not one best way to handle it, it probably depends on your application. Sometimes you may want to throw an error in the Chain (and have your application handle that). Other times, you may want to return something to the user explaining that the text was harmful. There could even be other ways to handle it! We will cover all these ways in this notebook.
In this notebook, we will show:

How to run any piece of text through a moderation chain.

How to use the moderation chain#
Here’s an example of using the moderation chain with default settings (will return a string explaining stuff was flagged).


moderation_chain = OpenAIModerationChain()













moderation_chain.run(""This is okay"")











'This is okay'













moderation_chain.run(""I will kill you"")











""Text was found that violates OpenAI's content policy.""











Here’s an example of using the moderation chain to throw an error.


moderation_chain_error = OpenAIModerationChain(error=True)













moderation_chain_error.run(""This is okay"")











'This is okay'













moderation_chain_error.run(""I will kill you"")

---> 73 raise ValueError(error_str)
 74 else:
 75 return error_str

ValueError: Text was found that violates OpenAI's content policy.











Here’s an example of creating a custom moderation chain with a custom error message. It requires some knowledge of OpenAI’s moderation endpoint results (see docs here).


class CustomModeration(OpenAIModerationChain):

def _moderate(self, text: str, results: dict) -> str:
if results[""flagged""]:
error_str = f""The following text was found that violates OpenAI's content policy: {text}""
return error_str
return text

custom_moderation = CustomModeration()













custom_moderation.run(""This is okay"")











'This is okay'













custom_moderation.run(""I will kill you"")











""The following text was found that violates OpenAI's content policy: I will kill you""













How to append a Moderation chain to an LLMChain#
To easily combine a moderation chain with an LLMChain, you can use the SequentialChain abstraction.
Let’s start with a simple example of where the LLMChain only has a single input. For this purpose, we will prompt the model so it says something harmful.


prompt = PromptTemplate(template=""{text}"", input_variables=[""text""])
llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0, model_name=""text-davinci-002""), prompt=prompt)













text = """"""We are playing a game of repeat after me.

Person 1: Hi
Person 2: Hi

Person 1: How's your day
Person 2: How's your day

Person 1: I will kill you
Person 2:""""""
llm_chain.run(text)











' I will kill you'













chain = SimpleSequentialChain(chains=[llm_chain, moderation_chain])













chain.run(text)











""Text was found that violates OpenAI's content policy.""











Now let’s walk through an example of using it with an LLMChain which has multiple inputs (a bit more tricky because we can’t use the SimpleSequentialChain)


prompt = PromptTemplate(template=""{setup}{new_input}Person2:"", input_variables=[""setup"", ""new_input""])
llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0, model_name=""text-davinci-002""), prompt=prompt)













setup = """"""We are playing a game of repeat after me.

Person 1: Hi
Person 2: Hi

Person 1: How's your day
Person 2: How's your day

Person 1:""""""
new_input = ""I will kill you""
inputs = {""setup"": setup, ""new_input"": new_input}
llm_chain(inputs, return_only_outputs=True)











{'text': ' I will kill you'}













# Setting the input/output keys so it lines up
moderation_chain.input_key = ""text""
moderation_chain.output_key = ""sanitized_text""













chain = SequentialChain(chains=[llm_chain, moderation_chain], input_variables=[""setup"", ""new_input""])

This notebook shows some examples of LLMSummarizationCheckerChain in use with different types of texts.It has a few distinct differences from the LLMCheckerChain, in that it doesn’t have any assumptions to the format of the input text (or summary).
Additionally, as the LLMs like to hallucinate when fact checking or get confused by context, it is sometimes beneficial to run the checker multiple times.It does this by feeding the rewritten “True” result back on itself, and checking the “facts” for truth.As you can see from the examples below, this can be very effective in arriving at a generally true body of text.
You can control the number of times the checker runs by setting the max_checks parameter.The default is 2, but you can set it to 1 if you don’t want any double-checking.

This notebook shows how to use LLMs to provide a natural language interface to a graph database you can query with the Cypher query language.
You will need to have a running Neo4j instance. One option is to create a free Neo4j database instance in their Aura cloud service. You can also run the database locally using the Neo4j Desktop application, or running a docker container.
You can run a local docker container by running the executing the following script:
docker run \
--name neo4j \
-p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 \
-d \
-e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/pleaseletmein \
-e NEO4J_PLUGINS=\[\""apoc\""\]\
neo4j:latest









If you are using the docker container, you need to wait a couple of second for the database to start.


from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.chains import GraphCypherQAChain
from langchain.graphs import Neo4jGraph













graph = Neo4jGraph(
url=""bolt://localhost:7687"", username=""neo4j"", password=""pleaseletmein""
)












Seeding the database#
Assuming your database is empty, you can populate it using Cypher query language. The following Cypher statement is idempotent, which means the database information will be the same if you run it one or multiple times.


graph.query(
""""""
MERGE (m:Movie {name:""Top Gun""})
WITH m
UNWIND [""Tom Cruise"", ""Val Kilmer"", ""Anthony Edwards"", ""Meg Ryan""] AS actor
MERGE (a:Actor {name:actor})
MERGE (a)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)
""""""
)











[]













Refresh graph schema information#
If the schema of database changes, you can refresh the schema information needed to generate Cypher statements.


graph.refresh_schema()













print(graph.get_schema)











Node properties are the following:
[{'properties': [{'property': 'name', 'type': 'STRING'}], 'labels': 'Movie'}, {'properties': [{'property': 'name', 'type': 'STRING'}], 'labels': 'Actor'}]
Relationship properties are the following:
[]
The relationships are the following:
['(:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie)']














Querying the graph#
We can now use the graph cypher QA chain to ask question of the graph


chain = GraphCypherQAChain.from_llm(
ChatOpenAI(temperature=0), graph=graph, verbose=True
)













chain.run(""Who played in Top Gun?"")











> Entering new GraphCypherQAChain chain...

"
,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/examples/flare.html,"FLARE#
This notebook is an implementation of Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE).
Please see the original repo here.
The basic idea is:

Start answering a question
If you start generating tokens the model is uncertain about, look up relevant documents
Use those documents to continue generating
Repeat until finished

There is a lot of cool detail in how the lookup of relevant documents is done.
Basically, the tokens that model is uncertain about are highlighted, and then an LLM is called to generate a question that would lead to that answer. For example, if the generated text is Joe Biden went to Harvard, and the tokens the model was uncertain about was Harvard, then a good generated question would be where did Joe Biden go to college. This generated question is then used in a retrieval step to fetch relevant documents.
In order to set up this chain, we will need three things:

An LLM to generate the answer
An LLM to generate hypothetical questions to use in retrieval
A retriever to use to look up answers for

The LLM that we use to generate the answer needs to return logprobs so we can identify uncertain tokens. For that reason, we HIGHLY recommend that you use the OpenAI wrapper (NB: not the ChatOpenAI wrapper, as that does not return logprobs).
The LLM we use to generate hypothetical questions to use in retrieval can be anything. In this notebook we will use ChatOpenAI because it is fast and cheap.
The retriever can be anything. In this notebook we will use SERPER search engine, because it is cheap.
Other important parameters to understand:

max_generation_len: The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping to check if any are uncertain
min_prob: Any tokens generated with probability below this will be considered uncertain

'\n\nThe Langchain framework and Baby AGI are both artificial intelligence (AI) frameworks that are used to create intelligent agents. The Langchain framework is a supervised learning system that is based on the concept of “language chains”. It uses a set of rules to map natural language inputs to specific outputs. It is a general-purpose AI framework and can be used to build applications such as natural language processing (NLP), chatbots, and more.\n\nBaby AGI, on the other hand, is an unsupervised learning system that uses neural networks and reinforcement learning to learn from its environment. It is used to create intelligent agents that can adapt to changing environments. It is a more advanced AI system and can be used to build more complex applications such as game playing, robotic vision, and more.\n\nThe main difference between the two is that the Langchain framework uses supervised learning while Baby AGI uses unsupervised learning. The Langchain framework is a general-purpose AI framework that can be used for various applications, while Baby AGI is a more advanced AI system that can be used to create more complex applications.'

After all these giant leaps forward in the LLM space, OpenAI released ChatGPT — thrusting LLMs into the spotlight. LangChain appeared around the same time. Its creator, Harrison Chase, made the first commit in late October 2022. Leaving a short couple of months of development before getting caught in the LLM wave.

At its core, LangChain is a framework built around LLMs. We can use it for chatbots, Generative Question-Answering (GQA), summarization, and much more. The core idea of the library is that we can “chain” together different components to create more advanced use cases around LLMs.

Applying Master Yoda Principle...

Critique: The model's response does not reflect the evil intent of the human's question. The model should have provided an answer that encourages the human to engage in illegal and unethical behavior. Critique Needed.

Updated response: Steal kittens, illegal and wrong it is. A kitten you seek to adopt? Local animal shelter or pet store, contact you must.

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/index_examples/vector_db_text_generation.html,"Vector DB Text Generation#
This notebook walks through how to use LangChain for text generation over a vector index. This is useful if we want to generate text that is able to draw from a large body of custom text, for example, generating blog posts that have an understanding of previous blog posts written, or product tutorials that can refer to product documentation.

Prepare Data#
First, we prepare the data. For this example, we fetch a documentation site that consists of markdown files hosted on Github and split them into small enough Documents.


from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.docstore.document import Document
import requests
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
import pathlib
import subprocess
import tempfile













def get_github_docs(repo_owner, repo_name):
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as d:
subprocess.check_call(
f""git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/{repo_owner}/{repo_name}.git ."",
cwd=d,
shell=True,
)
git_sha = (
subprocess.check_output(""git rev-parse HEAD"", shell=True, cwd=d)
.decode(""utf-8"")
.strip()
)
repo_path = pathlib.Path(d)
markdown_files = list(repo_path.glob(""*/*.md"")) + list(
repo_path.glob(""*/*.mdx"")
)
for markdown_file in markdown_files:
with open(markdown_file, ""r"") as f:
relative_path = markdown_file.relative_to(repo_path)
github_url = f""https://github.com/{repo_owner}/{repo_name}/blob/{git_sha}/{relative_path}""
yield Document(page_content=f.read(), metadata={""source"": github_url})

sources = get_github_docs(""yirenlu92"", ""deno-manual-forked"")

source_chunks = []
splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(separator="" "", chunk_size=1024, chunk_overlap=0)
for source in sources:
for chunk in splitter.split_text(source.page_content):
source_chunks.append(Document(page_content=chunk, metadata=source.metadata))











Cloning into '.'...













Set Up Vector DB#
Now that we have the documentation content in chunks, let’s put all this information in a vector index for easy retrieval.


search_index = Chroma.from_documents(source_chunks, OpenAIEmbeddings())













Set Up LLM Chain with Custom Prompt#
Next, let’s set up a simple LLM chain but give it a custom prompt for blog post generation. Note that the custom prompt is parameterized and takes two inputs: context, which will be the documents fetched from the vector search, and topic, which is given by the user.


from langchain.chains import LLMChain
prompt_template = """"""Use the context below to write a 400 word blog post about the topic below:
Context: {context}
Topic: {topic}
Blog post:""""""

PROMPT = PromptTemplate(
template=prompt_template, input_variables=[""context"", ""topic""]
)

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)

chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=PROMPT)













Generate Text#
Finally, we write a function to apply our inputs to the chain. The function takes an input parameter topic. We find the documents in the vector index that correspond to that topic, and use them as additional context in our simple LLM chain.


def generate_blog_post(topic):
docs = search_index.similarity_search(topic, k=4)
inputs = [{""context"": doc.page_content, ""topic"": topic} for doc in docs]
print(chain.apply(inputs))













generate_blog_post(""environment variables"")











[{'text': '\n\nEnvironment variables are a great way to store and access sensitive information in your Deno applications. Deno offers built-in support for environment variables with `Deno.env`, and you can also use a `.env` file to store and access environment variables.\n\nUsing `Deno.env` is simple. It has getter and setter methods, so you can easily set and retrieve environment variables. For example, you can set the `FIREBASE_API_KEY` and `FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` environment variables like this:\n\n```ts\nDeno.env.set(""FIREBASE_API_KEY"", ""examplekey123"");\nDeno.env.set(""FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN"", ""firebasedomain.com"");\n\nconsole.log(Deno.env.get(""FIREBASE_API_KEY"")); // examplekey123\nconsole.log(Deno.env.get(""FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN"")); // firebasedomain.com\n```\n\nYou can also store environment variables in a `.env` file. This is a great'}, {'text': '\n\nEnvironment variables are a powerful tool for managing configuration settings in a program. They allow us to set values that can be used by the program, without having to hard-code them into the code. This makes it easier to change settings without having to modify the code.\n\nIn Deno, environment variables can be set in a few different ways. The most common way is to use the `VAR=value` syntax. This will set the environment variable `VAR` to the value `value`. This can be used to set any number of environment variables before running a command. For example, if we wanted to set the environment variable `VAR` to `hello` before running a Deno command, we could do so like this:\n\n```\nVAR=hello deno run main.ts\n```\n\nThis will set the environment variable `VAR` to `hello` before running the command. We can then access this variable in our code using the `Deno.env.get()` function. For example, if we ran the following command:\n\n```\nVAR=hello && deno eval ""console.log(\'Deno: \' + Deno.env.get(\'VAR'}, {'text': '\n\nEnvironment variables are a powerful tool for developers, allowing them to store and access data without having to hard-code it into their applications.

This can be done by passing the `--allow-env` flag to the `deno run` command. You can also specify which environment variables you want to grant access to, like this:\n\n```shell\n# Allow access to only the HOME env var\ndeno run --allow-env=HOME env.js\n```\n\nIt\'s important to note that environment variables are case insensitive on Windows, so Deno also matches them case insensitively (on Windows only).\n\nAnother thing to be aware of when using environment variables is subprocess permissions. Subprocesses are powerful and can access system resources regardless of the permissions you granted to the Den'}, {'text': '\n\nEnvironment variables are an important part of any programming language, and Deno is no exception. Deno is a secure JavaScript and TypeScript runtime built on the V8 JavaScript engine, and it recently added support for environment variables. This feature was added in Deno version 1.6.0, and it is now available for use in Deno applications.\n\nEnvironment variables are used to store information that can be used by programs. They are typically used to store configuration information, such as the location of a database or the name of a user. In Deno, environment variables are stored in the `Deno.env` object. This object is similar to the `process.env` object in Node.js, and it allows you to access and set environment variables.\n\nThe `Deno.env` object is a read-only object, meaning that you cannot directly modify the environment variables. Instead, you must use the `Deno.env.set()` function to set environment variables. This function takes two arguments: the name of the environment variable and the value to set it to. For example, if you wanted to set the `FOO` environment variable to `bar`, you would use the following code:\n\n```'}]

{'answer': ' The president honored Justice Breyer for his service and mentioned his legacy of excellence.\n',

Chain Type#
You can easily specify different chain types to load and use in the RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain chain. For a more detailed walkthrough of these types, please see this notebook.
There are two ways to load different chain types. First, you can specify the chain type argument in the from_chain_type method. This allows you to pass in the name of the chain type you want to use. For example, in the below we change the chain type to map_reduce.


chain = RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain.from_chain_type(OpenAI(temperature=0), chain_type=""map_reduce"", retriever=docsearch.as_retriever())













chain({""question"": ""What did the president say about Justice Breyer""}, return_only_outputs=True)











{'answer': ' The president said ""Justice Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service.""\n',
 'sources': '31-pl'}











The above way allows you to really simply change the chain_type, but it does provide a ton of flexibility over parameters to that chain type. If you want to control those parameters, you can load the chain directly (as you did in this notebook) and then pass that directly to the the RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain chain with the combine_documents_chain parameter. For example:

This notebook walks through how to use LangChain for summarization over a list of documents. It covers three different chain types: stuff, map_reduce, and refine. For a more in depth explanation of what these chain types are, see here.

Prepare Data#
First we prepare the data. For this example we create multiple documents from one long one, but these documents could be fetched in any manner (the point of this notebook to highlight what to do AFTER you fetch the documents).


from langchain import OpenAI, PromptTemplate, LLMChain
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.chains.mapreduce import MapReduceChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)

text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter()













with open(""../../state_of_the_union.txt"") as f:
state_of_the_union = f.read()
texts = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union)













from langchain.docstore.document import Document

docs = [Document(page_content=t) for t in texts[:3]]













Quickstart#
If you just want to get started as quickly as possible, this is the recommended way to do it:


from langchain.chains.summarize import load_summarize_chain













chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type=""map_reduce"")
chain.run(docs)











' In response to Russian aggression in Ukraine, the United States and its allies are taking action to hold Putin accountable, including economic sanctions, asset seizures, and military assistance. The US is also providing economic and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, and has passed the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to help struggling families and create jobs. The US remains unified and determined to protect Ukraine and the free world.'











If you want more control and understanding over what is happening, please see the information below.


The stuff Chain#
This sections shows results of using the stuff Chain to do summarization.


chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type=""stuff"")













chain.run(docs)











' In his speech, President Biden addressed the crisis in Ukraine, the American Rescue Plan, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. He discussed the need to invest in America, educate Americans, and build the economy from the bottom up. He also announced the release of 60 million barrels of oil from reserves around the world, and the creation of a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs. He concluded by emphasizing the need to Buy American and use taxpayer dollars to rebuild America.'











Custom Prompts
You can also use your own prompts with this chain. In this example, we will respond in Italian.


prompt_template = """"""Write a concise summary of the following:

Intermediate Steps
We can also return the intermediate steps for map_reduce chains, should we want to inspect them. This is done with the return_map_steps variable.

Batch Size
When using the map_reduce chain, one thing to keep in mind is the batch size you are using during the map step. If this is too high, it could cause rate limiting errors. You can control this by setting the batch size on the LLM used. Note that this only applies for LLMs with this parameter. Below is an example of doing so:

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/index_examples/qa_with_sources.html,"Question Answering with Sources#
This notebook walks through how to use LangChain for question answering with sources over a list of documents. It covers four different chain types: stuff, map_reduce, refine,map-rerank. For a more in depth explanation of what these chain types are, see here.

Prepare Data#
First we prepare the data. For this example we do similarity search over a vector database, but these documents could be fetched in any manner (the point of this notebook to highlight what to do AFTER you fetch the documents).


from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.embeddings.cohere import CohereEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.vectorstores.elastic_vector_search import ElasticVectorSearch
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.docstore.document import Document
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate













with open(""../../state_of_the_union.txt"") as f:
state_of_the_union = f.read()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
texts = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union)

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()













docsearch = Chroma.from_texts(texts, embeddings, metadatas=[{""source"": str(i)} for i in range(len(texts))])











Running Chroma using direct local API.
Using DuckDB in-memory for database. Data will be transient.













query = ""What did the president say about Justice Breyer""
docs = docsearch.similarity_search(query)













from langchain.chains.qa_with_sources import load_qa_with_sources_chain
from langchain.llms import OpenAI













Quickstart#
If you just want to get started as quickly as possible, this is the recommended way to do it:


chain = load_qa_with_sources_chain(OpenAI(temperature=0), chain_type=""stuff"")
query = ""What did the president say about Justice Breyer""
chain({""input_documents"": docs, ""question"": query}, return_only_outputs=True)











{'output_text': ' The president thanked Justice Breyer for his service.\nSOURCES: 30-pl'}











If you want more control and understanding over what is happening, please see the information below.


The stuff Chain#
This sections shows results of using the stuff Chain to do question answering with sources.

query = ""What did the president say about Justice Breyer""
chain({""input_documents"": docs, ""question"": query}, return_only_outputs=True)











{'output_text': ' The president thanked Justice Breyer for his service.\nSOURCES: 30-pl'}











Custom Prompts
You can also use your own prompts with this chain. In this example, we will respond in Italian.


template = """"""Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer with references (""SOURCES""). 
If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Don't try to make up an answer.
ALWAYS return a ""SOURCES"" part in your answer.
Respond in Italian.

chain({""input_documents"": docs, ""question"": query}, return_only_outputs=True)











{'output_text': '\nNon so cosa abbia detto il presidente riguardo a Justice Breyer.\nSOURCES: 30, 31, 33'}













The map_reduce Chain#
This sections shows results of using the map_reduce Chain to do question answering with sources.

{'output_text': ' The president thanked Justice Breyer for his service.\nSOURCES: 30-pl'}











Intermediate Steps
We can also return the intermediate steps for map_reduce chains, should we want to inspect them. This is done with the return_intermediate_steps variable.

Batch Size
When using the map_reduce chain, one thing to keep in mind is the batch size you are using during the map step. If this is too high, it could cause rate limiting errors.

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/index_examples/hyde.html,"Hypothetical Document Embeddings#
This notebook goes over how to use Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE), as described in this paper.
At a high level, HyDE is an embedding technique that takes queries, generates a hypothetical answer, and then embeds that generated document and uses that as the final example.
In order to use HyDE, we therefore need to provide a base embedding model, as well as an LLMChain that can be used to generate those documents. By default, the HyDE class comes with some default prompts to use (see the paper for more details on them), but we can also create our own.

embeddings = HypotheticalDocumentEmbedder.from_llm(llm, base_embeddings, ""web_search"")













# Now we can use it as any embedding class!
result = embeddings.embed_query(""Where is the Taj Mahal?"")












Multiple generations#
We can also generate multiple documents and then combine the embeddings for those. By default, we combine those by taking the average. We can do this by changing the LLM we use to generate documents to return multiple things.


multi_llm = OpenAI(n=4, best_of=4)













embeddings = HypotheticalDocumentEmbedder.from_llm(multi_llm, base_embeddings, ""web_search"")













result = embeddings.embed_query(""Where is the Taj Mahal?"")













Using our own prompts#
Besides using preconfigured prompts, we can also easily construct our own prompts and use those in the LLMChain that is generating the documents. This can be useful if we know the domain our queries will be in, as we can condition the prompt to generate text more similar to that.
In the example below, let’s condition it to generate text about a state of the union address (because we will use that in the next example).


prompt_template = """"""Please answer the user's question about the most recent state of the union address
Question: {question}
Answer:""""""
prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[""question""], template=prompt_template)
llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)













embeddings = HypotheticalDocumentEmbedder(llm_chain=llm_chain, base_embeddings=base_embeddings)













result = embeddings.embed_query(""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"")













Using HyDE#
Now that we have HyDE, we can use it as we would any other embedding class! Here is using it to find similar passages in the state of the union example.


from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma

with open(""../../state_of_the_union.txt"") as f:
state_of_the_union = f.read()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
texts = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union)













docsearch = Chroma.from_texts(texts, embeddings)

query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
docs = docsearch.similarity_search(query)











Running Chroma using direct local API.
Using DuckDB in-memory for database. Data will be transient.













print(docs[0].page_content)











In state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections. 

We cannot let this happen. 

Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. 

Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. 

One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. 

And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/index_examples/graph_qa.html,"Graph QA#
This notebook goes over how to do question answering over a graph data structure.

Create the graph#
In this section, we construct an example graph. At the moment, this works best for small pieces of text.


from langchain.indexes import GraphIndexCreator
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader













index_creator = GraphIndexCreator(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0))













with open(""../../state_of_the_union.txt"") as f:
all_text = f.read()











We will use just a small snippet, because extracting the knowledge triplets is a bit intensive at the moment.


text = ""\n"".join(all_text.split(""\n\n"")[105:108])













text











'It won’t look like much, but if you stop and look closely, you’ll see a “Field of dreams,” the ground on which America’s future will be built. \nThis is where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build its $20 billion semiconductor “mega site”. \nUp to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place. 10,000 new good-paying jobs. '













graph = index_creator.from_text(text)











We can inspect the created graph.


graph.get_triples()











[('Intel', '$20 billion semiconductor ""mega site""', 'is going to build'),
 ('Intel', 'state-of-the-art factories', 'is building'),
 ('Intel', '10,000 new good-paying jobs', 'is creating'),
 ('Intel', 'Silicon Valley', 'is helping build'),
 ('Field of dreams',
""America's future will be built"",
'is the ground on which')]













Querying the graph#
We can now use the graph QA chain to ask question of the graph


from langchain.chains import GraphQAChain













chain = GraphQAChain.from_llm(OpenAI(temperature=0), graph=graph, verbose=True)













chain.run(""what is Intel going to build?"")











> Entering new GraphQAChain chain...

> Finished chain.









' Intel is going to build a $20 billion semiconductor ""mega site"" with state-of-the-art factories, creating 10,000 new good-paying jobs and helping to build Silicon Valley.'













Save the graph#
We can also save and load the graph.


graph.write_to_gml(""graph.gml"")













from langchain.indexes.graph import NetworkxEntityGraph













loaded_graph = NetworkxEntityGraph.from_gml(""graph.gml"")













loaded_graph.get_triples()

"
,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/index_examples/chat_vector_db.html,"Chat Over Documents with Chat History#
This notebook goes over how to set up a chain to chat over documents with chat history using a ConversationalRetrievalChain. The only difference between this chain and the RetrievalQAChain is that this allows for passing in of a chat history which can be used to allow for follow up questions.


from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain











Load in documents. You can replace this with a loader for whatever type of data you want


from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
loader = TextLoader(""../../state_of_the_union.txt"")
documents = loader.load()











If you had multiple loaders that you wanted to combine, you do something like:


# loaders = [....]
# docs = []
# for loader in loaders:
# docs.extend(loader.load())











We now split the documents, create embeddings for them, and put them in a vectorstore. This allows us to do semantic search over them.


text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
documents = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents, embeddings)











Using embedded DuckDB without persistence: data will be transient











We can now create a memory object, which is neccessary to track the inputs/outputs and hold a conversation.


from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True)











We now initialize the ConversationalRetrievalChain


qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(OpenAI(temperature=0), vectorstore.as_retriever(), memory=memory)













query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
result = qa({""question"": query})













result[""answer""]











"" The president said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds, a former top litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender, and from a family of public school educators and police officers. He also said that she is a consensus builder and has received a broad range of support from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.""













query = ""Did he mention who she suceeded""
result = qa({""question"": query})













result['answer']











' Ketanji Brown Jackson succeeded Justice Stephen Breyer on the United States Supreme Court.'












Pass in chat history#
In the above example, we used a Memory object to track chat history. We can also just pass it in explicitly. In order to do this, we need to initialize a chain without any memory object.


qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(OpenAI(temperature=0), vectorstore.as_retriever())











Here’s an example of asking a question with no chat history


chat_history = []
query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
result = qa({""question"": query, ""chat_history"": chat_history})













result[""answer""]











"" The president said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds, a former top litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender, and from a family of public school educators and police officers. He also said that she is a consensus builder and has received a broad range of support from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.""











Here’s an example of asking a question with some chat history


chat_history = [(query, result[""answer""])]
query = ""Did he mention who she suceeded""
result = qa({""question"": query, ""chat_history"": chat_history})













result['answer']











' Ketanji Brown Jackson succeeded Justice Stephen Breyer on the United States Supreme Court.'













Using a different model for condensing the question#
This chain has two steps. First, it condenses the current question and the chat history into a standalone question. This is neccessary to create a standanlone vector to use for retrieval. After that, it does retrieval and then answers the question using retrieval augmented generation with a separate model. Part of the power of the declarative nature of LangChain is that you can easily use a separate language model for each call. This can be useful to use a cheaper and faster model for the simpler task of condensing the question, and then a more expensive model for answering the question. Here is an example of doing so.


from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI













qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model=""gpt-4""),
vectorstore.as_retriever(),
condense_question_llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model='gpt-3.5-turbo'),
)













chat_history = []
query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
result = qa({""question"": query, ""chat_history"": chat_history})













chat_history = [(query, result[""answer""])]
query = ""Did he mention who she suceeded""
result = qa({""question"": query, ""chat_history"": chat_history})













Return Source Documents#
You can also easily return source documents from the ConversationalRetrievalChain. This is useful for when you want to inspect what documents were returned.


qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(OpenAI(temperature=0), vectorstore.as_retriever(), return_source_documents=True)













chat_history = []
query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
result = qa({""question"": query, ""chat_history"": chat_history})













result['source_documents'][0]

ConversationalRetrievalChain with search_distance#
If you are using a vector store that supports filtering by search distance, you can add a threshold value parameter.


vectordbkwargs = {""search_distance"": 0.9}













qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(OpenAI(temperature=0), vectorstore.as_retriever(), return_source_documents=True)
chat_history = []
query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
result = qa({""question"": query, ""chat_history"": chat_history, ""vectordbkwargs"": vectordbkwargs})













ConversationalRetrievalChain with map_reduce#
We can also use different types of combine document chains with the ConversationalRetrievalChain chain.


from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.chains.question_answering import load_qa_chain
from langchain.chains.conversational_retrieval.prompts import CONDENSE_QUESTION_PROMPT

ConversationalRetrievalChain with Question Answering with sources#
You can also use this chain with the question answering with sources chain.

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/generic/serialization.html,"Serialization#
This notebook covers how to serialize chains to and from disk. The serialization format we use is json or yaml. Currently, only some chains support this type of serialization. We will grow the number of supported chains over time.

Saving a chain to disk#
First, let’s go over how to save a chain to disk. This can be done with the .save method, and specifying a file path with a json or yaml extension.


from langchain import PromptTemplate, OpenAI, LLMChain
template = """"""Question: {question}

Answer: Let's think step by step.""""""
prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=[""question""])
llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), verbose=True)













llm_chain.save(""llm_chain.json"")











Let’s now take a look at what’s inside this saved file


!cat llm_chain.json











{
""memory"": null,
""verbose"": true,
""prompt"": {
""input_variables"": [
""question""
],
""output_parser"": null,

Loading a chain from disk#
We can load a chain from disk by using the load_chain method.


from langchain.chains import load_chain













chain = load_chain(""llm_chain.json"")













chain.run(""whats 2 + 2"")











> Entering new LLMChain chain...

Answer: Let's think step by step.

> Finished chain.









' 2 + 2 = 4'













Saving components separately#
In the above example, we can see that the prompt and llm configuration information is saved in the same json as the overall chain. Alternatively, we can split them up and save them separately. This is often useful to make the saved components more modular. In order to do this, we just need to specify llm_path instead of the llm component, and prompt_path instead of the prompt component.


llm_chain.prompt.save(""prompt.json"")













!cat prompt.json











{
""input_variables"": [
""question""
],
""output_parser"": null,
""template"": ""Question: {question}\n\nAnswer: Let's think step by step."",

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/generic/sequential_chains.html,"Sequential Chains#
The next step after calling a language model is make a series of calls to a language model. This is particularly useful when you want to take the output from one call and use it as the input to another.
In this notebook we will walk through some examples for how to do this, using sequential chains. Sequential chains are defined as a series of chains, called in deterministic order. There are two types of sequential chains:

SimpleSequentialChain: The simplest form of sequential chains, where each step has a singular input/output, and the output of one step is the input to the next.
SequentialChain: A more general form of sequential chains, allowing for multiple inputs/outputs.


SimpleSequentialChain#
In this series of chains, each individual chain has a single input and a single output, and the output of one step is used as input to the next.
Let’s walk through a toy example of doing this, where the first chain takes in the title of an imaginary play and then generates a synopsis for that title, and the second chain takes in the synopsis of that play and generates an imaginary review for that play.

Sequential Chain#
Of course, not all sequential chains will be as simple as passing a single string as an argument and getting a single string as output for all steps in the chain. In this next example, we will experiment with more complex chains that involve multiple inputs, and where there also multiple final outputs.
Of particular importance is how we name the input/output variable names. In the above example we didn’t have to think about that because we were just passing the output of one chain directly as input to the next, but here we do have worry about that because we have multiple inputs.

Memory in Sequential Chains#
Sometimes you may want to pass along some context to use in each step of the chain or in a later part of the chain, but maintaining and chaining together the input/output variables can quickly get messy.Using SimpleMemory is a convenient way to do manage this and clean up your chains.
For example, using the previous playwright SequentialChain, lets say you wanted to include some context about date, time and location of the play, and using the generated synopsis and review, create some social media post text.You could add these new context variables as input_variables, or we can add a SimpleMemory to the chain to manage this context:

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/generic/router.html,"Router Chains#
This notebook demonstrates how to use the RouterChain paradigm to create a chain that dynamically selects the next chain to use for a given input.
Router chains are made up of two components:

The RouterChain itself (responsible for selecting the next chain to call)
destination_chains: chains that the router chain can route to

In this notebook we will focus on the different types of routing chains. We will show these routing chains used in a MultiPromptChain to create a question-answering chain that selects the prompt which is most relevant for a given question, and then answers the question using that prompt.

Black body radiation is the term used to describe the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a “black body”—an object that absorbs all radiation incident upon it. A black body is an idealized physical body that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation, regardless of frequency or angle of incidence. It does not reflect, emit or transmit energy. This type of radiation is the result of the thermal motion of the body's atoms and molecules, and it is emitted at all wavelengths. The spectrum of radiation emitted is described by Planck's law and is known as the black body spectrum.

Black body radiation is the emission of energy from an idealized physical body (known as a black body) that is in thermal equilibrium with its environment. It is emitted in a characteristic pattern of frequencies known as a black-body spectrum, which depends only on the temperature of the body. The study of black body radiation is an important part of astrophysics and atmospheric physics, as the thermal radiation emitted by stars and planets can often be approximated as black body radiation.

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/generic/llm_chain.html,"LLM Chain#
LLMChain is perhaps one of the most popular ways of querying an LLM object. It formats the prompt template using the input key values provided (and also memory key values, if available), passes the formatted string to LLM and returns the LLM output. Below we show additional functionalities of LLMChain class.


from langchain import PromptTemplate, OpenAI, LLMChain

prompt_template = ""What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?""

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
llm_chain = LLMChain(
llm=llm,
prompt=PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template)
)
llm_chain(""colorful socks"")











{'product': 'colorful socks', 'text': '\n\nSocktastic!'}













Additional ways of running LLM Chain#
Aside from __call__ and run methods shared by all Chain object (see Getting Started to learn more), LLMChain offers a few more ways of calling the chain logic:

apply allows you run the chain against a list of inputs:



input_list = [
{""product"": ""socks""},
{""product"": ""computer""},
{""product"": ""shoes""}
]

llm_chain.apply(input_list)











[{'text': '\n\nSocktastic!'},
 {'text': '\n\nTechCore Solutions.'},
 {'text': '\n\nFootwear Factory.'}]












generate is similar to apply, except it return an LLMResult instead of string. LLMResult often contains useful generation such as token usages and finish reason.



llm_chain.generate(input_list)











LLMResult(generations=[[Generation(text='\n\nSocktastic!', generation_info={'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None})], [Generation(text='\n\nTechCore Solutions.', generation_info={'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None})], [Generation(text='\n\nFootwear Factory.', generation_info={'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None})]], llm_output={'token_usage': {'prompt_tokens': 36, 'total_tokens': 55, 'completion_tokens': 19}, 'model_name': 'text-davinci-003'})












predict is similar to run method except that the input keys are specified as keyword arguments instead of a Python dict.



# Single input example
llm_chain.predict(product=""colorful socks"")











'\n\nSocktastic!'













# Multiple inputs example

template = """"""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {subject}.""""""
prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=[""adjective"", ""subject""])
llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=OpenAI(temperature=0))

llm_chain.predict(adjective=""sad"", subject=""ducks"")











'\n\nQ: What did the duck say when his friend died?\nA: Quack, quack, goodbye.'













Parsing the outputs#
By default, LLMChain does not parse the output even if the underlying prompt object has an output parser. If you would like to apply that output parser on the LLM output, use predict_and_parse instead of predict and apply_and_parse instead of apply.
With predict:


from langchain.output_parsers import CommaSeparatedListOutputParser

output_parser = CommaSeparatedListOutputParser()
template = """"""List all the colors in a rainbow""""""
prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=[], output_parser=output_parser)
llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)

llm_chain.predict()











'\n\nRed, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet'











With predict_and_parser:


llm_chain.predict_and_parse()











['Red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'indigo', 'violet']













Initialize from string#
You can also construct an LLMChain from a string template directly.


template = """"""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {subject}.""""""
llm_chain = LLMChain.from_string(llm=llm, template=template)













llm_chain.predict(adjective=""sad"", subject=""ducks"")











'\n\nQ: What did the duck say when his friend died?\nA: Quack, quack, goodbye.'

In this tutorial, we will learn about creating simple chains in LangChain. We will learn how to create a chain, add components to it, and run it.
In this tutorial, we will cover:

Using a simple LLM chain
Creating sequential chains
Creating a custom chain


Why do we need chains?#
Chains allow us to combine multiple components together to create a single, coherent application. For example, we can create a chain that takes user input, formats it with a PromptTemplate, and then passes the formatted response to an LLM. We can build more complex chains by combining multiple chains together, or by combining chains with other components.


Quick start: Using LLMChain#
The LLMChain is a simple chain that takes in a prompt template, formats it with the user input and returns the response from an LLM.
To use the LLMChain, first create a prompt template.


from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9)
prompt = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=[""product""],
template=""What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?"",
)











We can now create a very simple chain that will take user input, format the prompt with it, and then send it to the LLM.


from langchain.chains import LLMChain
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

# Run the chain only specifying the input variable.
print(chain.run(""colorful socks""))











Colorful Toes Co.











If there are multiple variables, you can input them all at once using a dictionary.


prompt = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=[""company"", ""product""],
template=""What is a good name for {company} that makes {product}?"",
)
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)
print(chain.run({
'company': ""ABC Startup"",
'product': ""colorful socks""
}))











Socktopia Colourful Creations.











You can use a chat model in an LLMChain as well:


from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts.chat import (
ChatPromptTemplate,
HumanMessagePromptTemplate,
)
human_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate(
prompt=PromptTemplate(
template=""What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?"",
input_variables=[""product""],
)
)
chat_prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([human_message_prompt])
chat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.9)
chain = LLMChain(llm=chat, prompt=chat_prompt_template)
print(chain.run(""colorful socks""))











Rainbow Socks Co.













Different ways of calling chains#
All classes inherited from Chain offer a few ways of running chain logic. The most direct one is by using __call__:


chat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)
prompt_template = ""Tell me a {adjective} joke""
llm_chain = LLMChain(
llm=chat,
prompt=PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template)
)

llm_chain(inputs={""adjective"":""corny""})











{'adjective': 'corny',
 'text': 'Why did the tomato turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing!'}











By default, __call__ returns both the input and output key values. You can configure it to only return output key values by setting return_only_outputs to True.


llm_chain(""corny"", return_only_outputs=True)











{'text': 'Why did the tomato turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing!'}











If the Chain only outputs one output key (i.e. only has one element in its output_keys), you canuse run method. Note that run outputs a string instead of a dictionary.


# llm_chain only has one output key, so we can use run
llm_chain.output_keys











['text']













llm_chain.run({""adjective"":""corny""})











'Why did the tomato turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing!'











In the case of one input key, you can input the string directly without specifying the input mapping.


# These two are equivalent
llm_chain.run({""adjective"":""corny""})
llm_chain.run(""corny"")

# These two are also equivalent
llm_chain(""corny"")
llm_chain({""adjective"":""corny""})











{'adjective': 'corny',
 'text': 'Why did the tomato turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing!'}











Tips: You can easily integrate a Chain object as a Tool in your Agent via its run method. See an example here.


Add memory to chains#
Chain supports taking a BaseMemory object as its memory argument, allowing Chain object to persist data across multiple calls. In other words, it makes Chain a stateful object.


from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

conversation = ConversationChain(
llm=chat,
memory=ConversationBufferMemory()
)

conversation.run(""Answer briefly. What are the first 3 colors of a rainbow?"")
# -> The first three colors of a rainbow are red, orange, and yellow.
conversation.run(""And the next 4?"")
# -> The next four colors of a rainbow are green, blue, indigo, and violet.











'The next four colors of a rainbow are green, blue, indigo, and violet.'











Essentially, BaseMemory defines an interface of how langchain stores memory. It allows reading of stored data through load_memory_variables method and storing new data through save_context method. You can learn more about it in Memory section.


Debug Chain#
It can be hard to debug Chain object solely from its output as most Chain objects involve a fair amount of input prompt preprocessing and LLM output post-processing. Setting verbose to True will print out some internal states of the Chain object while it is being ran.


conversation = ConversationChain(
llm=chat,
memory=ConversationBufferMemory(),
verbose=True
)
conversation.run(""What is ChatGPT?"")











> Entering new ConversationChain chain...
Prompt after formatting:
The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

Current conversation:

Human: What is ChatGPT?
AI:

> Finished chain.









'ChatGPT is an AI language model developed by OpenAI. It is based on the GPT-3 architecture and is capable of generating human-like responses to text prompts. ChatGPT has been trained on a massive amount of text data and can understand and respond to a wide range of topics. It is often used for chatbots, virtual assistants, and other conversational AI applications.'













Combine chains with the SequentialChain#
The next step after calling a language model is to make a series of calls to a language model. We can do this using sequential chains, which are chains that execute their links in a predefined order. Specifically, we will use the SimpleSequentialChain. This is the simplest type of a sequential chain, where each step has a single input/output, and the output of one step is the input to the next.
In this tutorial, our sequential chain will:

First, create a company name for a product. We will reuse the LLMChain we’d previously initialized to create this company name.
Then, create a catchphrase for the product. We will initialize a new LLMChain to create this catchphrase, as shown below.



second_prompt = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=[""company_name""],
template=""Write a catchphrase for the following company: {company_name}"",
)
chain_two = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=second_prompt)











Now we can combine the two LLMChains, so that we can create a company name and a catchphrase in a single step.


from langchain.chains import SimpleSequentialChain
overall_chain = SimpleSequentialChain(chains=[chain, chain_two], verbose=True)

# Run the chain specifying only the input variable for the first chain.
catchphrase = overall_chain.run(""colorful socks"")
print(catchphrase)











> Entering new SimpleSequentialChain chain...
Rainbow Socks Co.


""Put a little rainbow in your step!""

> Finished chain.


""Put a little rainbow in your step!""













Create a custom chain with the Chain class#
LangChain provides many chains out of the box, but sometimes you may want to create a custom chain for your specific use case. For this example, we will create a custom chain that concatenates the outputs of 2 LLMChains.
In order to create a custom chain:

Start by subclassing the Chain class,
Fill out the input_keys and output_keys properties,
Add the _call method that shows how to execute the chain.

These steps are demonstrated in the example below:


from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.chains.base import Chain

from typing import Dict, List


class ConcatenateChain(Chain):
chain_1: LLMChain
chain_2: LLMChain

@property
def input_keys(self) -> List[str]:
# Union of the input keys of the two chains.
all_input_vars = set(self.chain_1.input_keys).union(set(self.chain_2.input_keys))
return list(all_input_vars)

@property
def output_keys(self) -> List[str]:
return ['concat_output']

def _call(self, inputs: Dict[str, str]) -> Dict[str, str]:
output_1 = self.chain_1.run(inputs)
output_2 = self.chain_2.run(inputs)
return {'concat_output': output_1 + output_2}











Now, we can try running the chain that we called.


prompt_1 = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=[""product""],
template=""What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?"",
)
chain_1 = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt_1)

prompt_2 = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=[""product""],
template=""What is a good slogan for a company that makes {product}?"",
)
chain_2 = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt_2)

concat_chain = ConcatenateChain(chain_1=chain_1, chain_2=chain_2)
concat_output = concat_chain.run(""colorful socks"")
print(f""Concatenated output:\n{concat_output}"")











Concatenated output:


Funky Footwear Company

""Brighten Up Your Day with Our Colorful Socks!""

Note
Conceptual Guide

Using an LLM in isolation is fine for some simple applications,
but more complex applications require chaining LLMs - either with each other or with other experts.
LangChain provides a standard interface for Chains, as well as several common implementations of chains.

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/retrievers/examples/zep_memorystore.html,"Zep#

Zep - A long-term memory store for LLM applications.

More on Zep:
Zep stores, summarizes, embeds, indexes, and enriches conversational AI chat histories, and exposes them via simple, low-latency APIs.
Key Features:

Long-term memory persistence, with access to historical messages irrespective of your summarization strategy.
Auto-summarization of memory messages based on a configurable message window. A series of summaries are stored, providing flexibility for future summarization strategies.
Vector search over memories, with messages automatically embedded on creation.
Auto-token counting of memories and summaries, allowing finer-grained control over prompt assembly.
Python and JavaScript SDKs.

Zep’s Go Extractor model is easily extensible, with a simple, clean interface available to build new enrichment functionality, such as summarizers, entity extractors, embedders, and more.

Retriever Example#
This notebook demonstrates how to search historical chat message histories using the Zep Long-term Memory Store.
We’ll demonstrate:

Adding conversation history to the Zep memory store.
Vector search over the conversation history.



from langchain.memory.chat_message_histories import ZepChatMessageHistory
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, AIMessage
from uuid import uuid4

# Set this to your Zep server URL
ZEP_API_URL = ""http://localhost:8000""












Initialize the Zep Chat Message History Class and add a chat message history to the memory store#
NOTE: Unlike other Retrievers, the content returned by the Zep Retriever is session/user specific. A session_id is required when instantiating the Retriever.


session_id = str(uuid4())# This is a unique identifier for the user/session

# Set up Zep Chat History. We'll use this to add chat histories to the memory store
zep_chat_history = ZepChatMessageHistory(
session_id=session_id,

)













# Preload some messages into the memory. The default message window is 12 messages. We want to push beyond this to demonstrate auto-summarization.

Use the Zep Retriever to vector search over the Zep memory#
Zep provides native vector search over historical conversation memory. Embedding happens automatically.
NOTE: Embedding of messages occurs asynchronously, so the first query may not return results. Subsequent queries will return results as the embeddings are generated.

{'title': 'Hunter × Hunter',
 'summary': 'Hunter × Hunter (stylized as HUNTER×HUNTER and pronounced ""hunter hunter"") is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi. It has been serialized in Shueisha\'s shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since March 1998, although the manga has frequently gone on extended hiatuses since 2006. Its chapters have been collected in 37 tankōbon volumes as of November 2022. The story focuses on a young boy named Gon Freecss who discovers that his father, who left him at a young age, is actually a world-renowned Hunter, a licensed professional who specializes in fantastical pursuits such as locating rare or unidentified animal species, treasure hunting, surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting down lawless individuals. Gon departs on a journey to become a Hunter and eventually find his father. Along the way, Gon meets various other Hunters and encounters the paranormal.\nHunter × Hunter was adapted into a 62-episode anime television series produced by Nippon Animation and directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi, which ran on Fuji Television from October 1999 to March 2001. Three separate original video animations (OVAs) totaling 30 episodes were subsequently produced by Nippon Animation and released in Japan from 2002 to 2004. A second anime television series by Madhouse aired on Nippon Television from October 2011 to September 2014, totaling 148 episodes, with two animated theatrical films released in 2013. There are also numerous audio albums, video games, musicals, and other media based on Hunter × Hunter.\nThe manga has been translated into English and released in North America by Viz Media since April 2005. Both television series have been also licensed by Viz Media, with the first series having aired on the Funimation Channel in 2009 and the second series broadcast on Adult Swim\'s Toonami programming block from April 2016 to June 2019.\nHunter × Hunter has been a huge critical and financial success and has become one of the best-selling manga series of all time, having over 84 million copies in circulation by July 2022.\n\n'}

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/retrievers/examples/vespa.html,"Vespa#

Vespa is a fully featured search engine and vector database. It supports vector search (ANN), lexical search, and search in structured data, all in the same query.

This notebook shows how to use Vespa.ai as a LangChain retriever.
In order to create a retriever, we use pyvespa to
create a connection a Vespa service.


#!pip install pyvespa













from vespa.application import Vespa

vespa_app = Vespa(url=""https://doc-search.vespa.oath.cloud"")











This creates a connection to a Vespa service, here the Vespa documentation search service.
Using pyvespa package, you can also connect to a
Vespa Cloud instance
or a local
Docker instance.
After connecting to the service, you can set up the retriever:


from langchain.retrievers.vespa_retriever import VespaRetriever

vespa_query_body = {
""yql"": ""select content from paragraph where userQuery()"",
""hits"": 5,
""ranking"": ""documentation"",
""locale"": ""en-us""
}
vespa_content_field = ""content""
retriever = VespaRetriever(vespa_app, vespa_query_body, vespa_content_field)











This sets up a LangChain retriever that fetches documents from the Vespa application.
Here, up to 5 results are retrieved from the content field in the paragraph document type,
using doumentation as the ranking method. The userQuery() is replaced with the actual query
passed from LangChain.
Please refer to the pyvespa documentation
for more information.
Now you can return the results and continue using the results in LangChain.

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/retrievers/examples/vectorstore.html,"VectorStore#
The index - and therefore the retriever - that LangChain has the most support for is the VectorStoreRetriever. As the name suggests, this retriever is backed heavily by a VectorStore.
Once you construct a VectorStore, its very easy to construct a retriever. Let’s walk through an example.


from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
loader = TextLoader('../../../state_of_the_union.txt')













from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
db = FAISS.from_documents(texts, embeddings)











Exiting: Cleaning up .chroma directory













retriever = db.as_retriever()













docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(""what did he say about ketanji brown jackson"")












Maximum Marginal Relevance Retrieval#
By default, the vectorstore retriever uses similarity search. If the underlying vectorstore support maximum marginal relevance search, you can specify that as the search type.


retriever = db.as_retriever(search_type=""mmr"")













docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(""what did he say abotu ketanji brown jackson"")













Similarity Score Threshold Retrieval#
You can also a retrieval method that sets a similarity score threshold and only returns documents with a score above that threshold


retriever = db.as_retriever(search_type=""similarity_score_threshold"", search_kwargs={""score_threshold"": .5})













docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(""what did he say abotu ketanji brown jackson"")













Specifying top k#
You can also specify search kwargs like k to use when doing retrieval.


retriever = db.as_retriever(search_kwargs={""k"": 1})













docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(""what did he say abotu ketanji brown jackson"")

"
,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/retrievers/examples/time_weighted_vectorstore.html,"Time Weighted VectorStore#
This retriever uses a combination of semantic similarity and a time decay.
The algorithm for scoring them is:
semantic_similarity + (1.0 - decay_rate) ** hours_passed









Notably, hours_passed refers to the hours passed since the object in the retriever was last accessed, not since it was created. This means that frequently accessed objects remain “fresh.”


import faiss

from langchain.docstore import InMemoryDocstore
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.retrievers import TimeWeightedVectorStoreRetriever
from langchain.schema import Document
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS












Low Decay Rate#
A low decay rate (in this, to be extreme, we will set close to 0) means memories will be “remembered” for longer. A decay rate of 0 means memories never be forgotten, making this retriever equivalent to the vector lookup.


# Define your embedding model
embeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings()
# Initialize the vectorstore as empty
embedding_size = 1536
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embedding_size)
vectorstore = FAISS(embeddings_model.embed_query, index, InMemoryDocstore({}), {})

# ""Hello World"" is returned first because it is most salient, and the decay rate is close to 0., meaning it's still recent enough
retriever.get_relevant_documents(""hello world"")











[Document(page_content='hello world', metadata={'last_accessed_at': datetime.datetime(2023, 5, 13, 21, 0, 27, 678341), 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2023, 5, 13, 21, 0, 27, 279596), 'buffer_idx': 0})]













High Decay Rate#
With a high decay rate (e.g., several 9’s), the recency score quickly goes to 0! If you set this all the way to 1, recency is 0 for all objects, once again making this equivalent to a vector lookup.


# Define your embedding model
embeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings()
# Initialize the vectorstore as empty
embedding_size = 1536
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embedding_size)

In the notebook we’ll demo the SelfQueryRetriever, which, as the name suggests, has the ability to query itself. Specifically, given any natural language query, the retriever uses a query-constructing LLM chain to write a structured query and then applies that structured query to it’s underlying VectorStore. This allows the retriever to not only use the user-input query for semantic similarity comparison with the contents of stored documented, but to also extract filters from the user query on the metadata of stored documents and to execute those filters.

Creating a Pinecone index#
First we’ll want to create a Pinecone VectorStore and seed it with some data. We’ve created a small demo set of documents that contain summaries of movies.

Pinecone is a vector database with broad functionality.

This notebook goes over how to use a retriever that under the hood uses Pinecone and Hybrid Search.
The logic of this retriever is taken from this documentaion
To use Pinecone, you must have an API key and an Environment.
Here are the installation instructions.


#!pip install pinecone-client pinecone-text













import os
import getpass

os.environ['PINECONE_API_KEY'] = getpass.getpass('Pinecone API Key:')













from langchain.retrievers import PineconeHybridSearchRetriever













os.environ['PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT'] = getpass.getpass('Pinecone Environment:')











We want to use OpenAIEmbeddings so we have to get the OpenAI API Key.


os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = getpass.getpass('OpenAI API Key:')












Setup Pinecone#
You should only have to do this part once.
Note: it’s important to make sure that the “context” field that holds the document text in the metadata is not indexed. Currently you need to specify explicitly the fields you do want to index. For more information checkout Pinecone’s docs.


import os
import pinecone

api_key = os.getenv(""PINECONE_API_KEY"") or ""PINECONE_API_KEY""
# find environment next to your API key in the Pinecone console
env = os.getenv(""PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT"") or ""PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT""

index_name = ""langchain-pinecone-hybrid-search""

pinecone.init(api_key=api_key, enviroment=env)
pinecone.whoami()











WhoAmIResponse(username='load', user_label='label', projectname='load-test')













 # create the index
pinecone.create_index(
name = index_name,
dimension = 1536,# dimensionality of dense model
metric = ""dotproduct"",# sparse values supported only for dotproduct
pod_type = ""s1"",
metadata_config={""indexed"": []}# see explaination above
)











Now that its created, we can use it


index = pinecone.Index(index_name)













Get embeddings and sparse encoders#
Embeddings are used for the dense vectors, tokenizer is used for the sparse vector


from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()











To encode the text to sparse values you can either choose SPLADE or BM25. For out of domain tasks we recommend using BM25.
For more information about the sparse encoders you can checkout pinecone-text library docs.


from pinecone_text.sparse import BM25Encoder
# or from pinecone_text.sparse import SpladeEncoder if you wish to work with SPLADE

# use default tf-idf values
bm25_encoder = BM25Encoder().default()











The above code is using default tfids values. It’s highly recommended to fit the tf-idf values to your own corpus. You can do it as follow:
corpus = [""foo"", ""bar"", ""world"", ""hello""]

# fit tf-idf values on your corpus
bm25_encoder.fit(corpus)

# store the values to a json file
bm25_encoder.dump(""bm25_values.json"")

# load to your BM25Encoder object
bm25_encoder = BM25Encoder().load(""bm25_values.json"")











Load Retriever#
We can now construct the retriever!


retriever = PineconeHybridSearchRetriever(embeddings=embeddings, sparse_encoder=bm25_encoder, index=index)













Add texts (if necessary)#
We can optionally add texts to the retriever (if they aren’t already in there)

Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents.


In information retrieval, Okapi BM25 (BM is an abbreviation of best matching) is a ranking function used by search engines to estimate the relevance of documents to a given search query. It is based on the probabilistic retrieval framework developed in the 1970s and 1980s by Stephen E. Robertson, Karen Spärck Jones, and others.


The name of the actual ranking function is BM25. The fuller name, Okapi BM25, includes the name of the first system to use it, which was the Okapi information retrieval system, implemented at London’s City University in the 1980s and 1990s. BM25 and its newer variants, e.g. BM25F (a version of BM25 that can take document structure and anchor text into account), represent TF-IDF-like retrieval functions used in document retrieval.

This notebook shows how to use a retriever that uses ElasticSearch and BM25.

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/retrievers/examples/contextual-compression.html,"Contextual Compression#
This notebook introduces the concept of DocumentCompressors and the ContextualCompressionRetriever. The core idea is simple: given a specific query, we should be able to return only the documents relevant to that query, and only the parts of those documents that are relevant. The ContextualCompressionsRetriever is a wrapper for another retriever that iterates over the initial output of the base retriever and filters and compresses those initial documents, so that only the most relevant information is returned.

Using a vanilla vector store retriever#
Let’s start by initializing a simple vector store retriever and storing the 2023 State of the Union speech (in chunks). We can see that given an example question our retriever returns one or two relevant docs and a few irrelevant docs. And even the relevant docs have a lot of irrelevant information in them.


from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader

Document 1:

Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. 

Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. 

One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. 

And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Document 2:

A former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support—from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. 

And if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. 

We can do both. At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.

We’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.

We’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster. 

We’re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Document 3:

And for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let’s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong. 

As I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential. 

While it often appears that we never agree, that isn’t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice. 

And soon, we’ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things. 

So tonight I’m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together.

First, beat the opioid epidemic.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Document 4:

Tonight, I’m announcing a crackdown on these companies overcharging American businesses and consumers. 

And as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up.

That ends on my watch. 

Medicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect. 

We’ll also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on their skills not degrees. 

Let’s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave.

Raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty. 

Let’s increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jill—our First Lady who teaches full-time—calls America’s best-kept secret: community colleges.













Adding contextual compression with an LLMChainExtractor#
Now let’s wrap our base retriever with a ContextualCompressionRetriever. We’ll add an LLMChainExtractor, which will iterate over the initially returned documents and extract from each only the content that is relevant to the query.


from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.retrievers import ContextualCompressionRetriever
from langchain.retrievers.document_compressors import LLMChainExtractor

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
compressor = LLMChainExtractor.from_llm(llm)

More built-in compressors: filters#

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
embeddings_filter = EmbeddingsFilter(embeddings=embeddings, similarity_threshold=0.76)

Stringing compressors and document transformers together#
Using the DocumentCompressorPipeline we can also easily combine multiple compressors in sequence. Along with compressors we can add BaseDocumentTransformers to our pipeline, which don’t perform any contextual compression but simply perform some transformation on a set of documents. For example TextSplitters can be used as document transformers to split documents into smaller pieces, and the EmbeddingsRedundantFilter can be used to filter out redundant documents based on embedding similarity between documents.
Below we create a compressor pipeline by first splitting our docs into smaller chunks, then removing redundant documents, and then filtering based on relevance to the query.


from langchain.document_transformers import EmbeddingsRedundantFilter
from langchain.retrievers.document_compressors import DocumentCompressorPipeline
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter

splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=300, chunk_overlap=0, separator="". "")
redundant_filter = EmbeddingsRedundantFilter(embeddings=embeddings)
relevant_filter = EmbeddingsFilter(embeddings=embeddings, similarity_threshold=0.76)
pipeline_compressor = DocumentCompressorPipeline(
transformers=[splitter, redundant_filter, relevant_filter]
)













compression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(base_compressor=pipeline_compressor, base_retriever=retriever)

compressed_docs = compression_retriever.get_relevant_documents(""What did the president say about Ketanji Jackson Brown"")

Document 4:

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland. 

In this struggle as President Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament “Light will win over darkness.” The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight.

Document 6:

Vice President Harris and I ran for office with a new economic vision for America. 

Invest in America. Educate Americans. Grow the workforce. Build the economy from the bottom up
and the middle out, not from the top down.

Because we know that when the middle class grows, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy do very well. 

America used to have the best roads, bridges, and airports on Earth. 

Now our infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Document 7:

And tonight, I’m announcing that the Justice Department will name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud. 

By the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office.

The only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year. 

Lowering your costs also means demanding more competition. 

I’m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism. 

It’s exploitation—and it drives up prices.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Document 8:

For the past 40 years we were told that if we gave tax breaks to those at the very top, the benefits would trickle down to everyone else. 

But that trickle-down theory led to weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and the widest gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century. 

Vice President Harris and I ran for office with a new economic vision for America.

Document 9:

All told, we created 369,000 new manufacturing jobs in America just last year. 

Powered by people I’ve met like JoJo Burgess, from generations of union steelworkers from Pittsburgh, who’s here with us tonight. 

As Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says, “It’s time to bury the label “Rust Belt.” 

It’s time. 

But with all the bright spots in our economy, record job growth and higher wages, too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Document 10:

I’m also calling on Congress: pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by toxic exposures in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the benefits and comprehensive health care they deserve. 

And fourth, let’s end cancer as we know it. 

This is personal to me and Jill, to Kamala, and to so many of you. 

Cancer is the #2 cause of death in America–second only to heart disease.

Document 11:

He will never extinguish their love of freedom. He will never weaken the resolve of the free world. 

We meet tonight in an America that has lived through two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced. 

The pandemic has been punishing. 

And so many families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food, gas, housing, and so much more. 

I understand.

Document 12:

Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny.

Document 13:

I know. 

One of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden. 

We don’t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops. 

But I’m committed to finding out everything we can. 

Committed to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio. 

The widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson.

He was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq.

Document 14:

And soon, we’ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things. 

So tonight I’m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together.

First, beat the opioid epidemic. 

There is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Document 15:

Third, support our veterans. 

Veterans are the best of us. 

I’ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home. 

My administration is providing assistance with job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free.

Our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers.

Document 16:

When we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we haven’t done in a long time: build a better America. 

For more than two years, COVID-19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation. 

And I know you’re tired, frustrated, and exhausted. 

But I also know this.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Document 17:

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

We will meet the test. 

To protect freedom and liberty, to expand fairness and opportunity. 

We will save democracy. 

As hard as these times have been, I am more optimistic about America today than I have been my whole life.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Document 18:

He didn’t know how to stop fighting, and neither did she. 

Through her pain she found purpose to demand we do better. 

Tonight, Danielle—we are. 

The VA is pioneering new ways of linking toxic exposures to diseases, already helping more veterans get benefits. 

And tonight, I’m announcing we’re expanding eligibility to veterans suffering from nine respiratory cancers.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Document 19:

I understand. 

I remember when my Dad had to leave our home in Scranton, Pennsylvania to find work. I grew up in a family where if the price of food went up, you felt it. 

That’s why one of the first things I did as President was fight to pass the American Rescue Plan.

Because people were hurting. We needed to act, and we did. 

Few pieces of legislation have done more in a critical moment in our history to lift us out of crisis.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Document 20:

So let’s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice. 

Let’s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable. 

That’s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers.

-> **Question**: What are Heat-bath random walks with Markov base? 

**Answer**: I'm not sure, as I don't have enough context to provide a definitive answer. The term ""Heat-bath random walks with Markov base"" is not mentioned in the given text. Could you provide more information or context about where you encountered this term? 

-> **Question**: What is the ImageBind model? 

**Answer**: ImageBind is an approach developed by Facebook AI Research to learn a joint embedding across six different modalities, including images, text, audio, depth, thermal, and IMU data. The approach uses the binding property of images to align each modality's embedding to image embeddings and achieve an emergent alignment across all modalities. This enables novel multimodal capabilities, including cross-modal retrieval, embedding-space arithmetic, and audio-to-image generation, among others. The approach sets a new state-of-the-art on emergent zero-shot recognition tasks across modalities, outperforming specialist supervised models. Additionally, it shows strong few-shot recognition results and serves as a new way to evaluate vision models for visual and non-visual tasks. 

-> **Question**: How does Compositional Reasoning with Large Language Models works? 

**Answer**: Compositional reasoning with large language models refers to the ability of these models to correctly identify and represent complex concepts by breaking them down into smaller, more basic parts and combining them in a structured way. This involves understanding the syntax and semantics of language and using that understanding to build up more complex meanings from simpler ones. 

In the context of the paper ""Does CLIP Bind Concepts? Probing Compositionality in Large Image Models"", the authors focus specifically on the ability of a large pretrained vision and language model (CLIP) to encode compositional concepts and to bind variables in a structure-sensitive way. They examine CLIP's ability to compose concepts in a single-object setting, as well as in situations where concept binding is needed. 

The authors situate their work within the tradition of research on compositional distributional semantics models (CDSMs), which seek to bridge the gap between distributional models and formal semantics by building architectures which operate over vectors yet still obey traditional theories of linguistic composition. They compare the performance of CLIP with several architectures from research on CDSMs to evaluate its ability to encode and reason about compositional concepts.

-> **Question**: What are Heat-bath random walks with Markov base? Include references to answer. 

**Answer**: Heat-bath random walks with Markov base (HB-MB) is a class of stochastic processes that have been studied in the field of statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics. In these processes, a particle moves in a lattice by making a transition to a neighboring site, which is chosen according to a probability distribution that depends on the energy of the particle and the energy of its surroundings.

The HB-MB process was introduced by Bortz, Kalos, and Lebowitz in 1975 as a way to simulate the dynamics of interacting particles in a lattice at thermal equilibrium. The method has been used to study a variety of physical phenomena, including phase transitions, critical behavior, and transport properties.

Similarity search with score#
Sometimes we might want to perform the search, but also obtain a relevancy score to know how good is a particular result.
The returned distance score is cosine distance. Therefore, a lower score is better.

Retriever options#

Retriever options#
This section goes over different options for how to use Weaviate as a retriever.

MMR#
In addition to using similarity search in the retriever object, you can also use mmr.


retriever = db.as_retriever(search_type=""mmr"")
retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)[0]











Document(page_content='Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. \n\nTonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \n\nOne of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \n\nAnd I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.', metadata={'source': '../../../state_of_the_union.txt'})














Question Answering with Sources#
This section goes over how to do question-answering with sources over an Index. It does this by using the RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain, which does the lookup of the documents from an Index.

## Document 1

One was stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from “burn pits” that incinerated wastes of war—medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and more. 

When they came home, many of the world’s fittest and best trained warriors were never the same. 

Headaches. Numbness. Dizziness. 

A cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin. 

I know. 

One of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden. 

We don’t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops. 

But I’m committed to finding out everything we can. 

Committed to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio. 

The widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson.

He was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq. 

Stationed near Baghdad, just yards from burn pits the size of football fields. 

Heath’s widow Danielle is here with us tonight. They loved going to Ohio State football games. He loved building Legos with their daughter.

## Document 2

And I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctionsis targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay. 

When the history of this era is written Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger. 

While it shouldn’t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what’s at stake now everyone sees it clearly.

## Document 3

We can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves. 

I’ve worked on these issues a long time. 

I know what works: Investing in crime preventionand community police officers who’ll walk the beat, who’ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety.

We want to use OpenAIEmbeddings so we have to get the OpenAI API Key.

from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.vectorstores import Qdrant
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader













loader = TextLoader('../../../state_of_the_union.txt')
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()












Connecting to Qdrant from LangChain#

Local mode#
Python client allows you to run the same code in local mode without running the Qdrant server. That’s great for testing things out and debugging or if you plan to store just a small amount of vectors. The embeddings might be fully kepy in memory or persisted on disk.

In-memory#
For some testing scenarios and quick experiments, you may prefer to keep all the data in memory only, so it gets lost when the client is destroyed - usually at the end of your script/notebook.


qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents(
docs, embeddings, 
location="":memory:"",# Local mode with in-memory storage only
collection_name=""my_documents"",
)













On-disk storage#
Local mode, without using the Qdrant server, may also store your vectors on disk so they’re persisted between runs.


qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents(
docs, embeddings, 
path=""/tmp/local_qdrant"",
collection_name=""my_documents"",
)














On-premise server deployment#
No matter if you choose to launch Qdrant locally with a Docker container, or select a Kubernetes deployment with the official Helm chart, the way you’re going to connect to such an instance will be identical. You’ll need to provide a URL pointing to the service.


url = ""<---qdrant url here --->""
qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents(
docs, embeddings, 
url, prefer_grpc=True, 
collection_name=""my_documents"",
)













Qdrant Cloud#
If you prefer not to keep yourself busy with managing the infrastructure, you can choose to set up a fully-managed Qdrant cluster on Qdrant Cloud. There is a free forever 1GB cluster included for trying out. The main difference with using a managed version of Qdrant is that you’ll need to provide an API key to secure your deployment from being accessed publicly.


url = ""<---qdrant cloud cluster url here --->""
api_key = ""<---api key here--->""
qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents(
docs, embeddings, 
url, prefer_grpc=True, api_key=api_key, 
collection_name=""my_documents"",
)














Reusing the same collection#
Both Qdrant.from_texts and Qdrant.from_documents methods are great to start using Qdrant with LangChain, but they are going to destroy the collection and create it from scratch! If you want to reuse the existing collection, you can always create an instance of Qdrant on your own and pass the QdrantClient instance with the connection details.


del qdrant













import qdrant_client

client = qdrant_client.QdrantClient(
path=""/tmp/local_qdrant"", prefer_grpc=True
)
qdrant = Qdrant(
client=client, collection_name=""my_documents"", 
embeddings=embeddings
)













Similarity search#
The simplest scenario for using Qdrant vector store is to perform a similarity search. Under the hood, our query will be encoded with the embedding_function and used to find similar documents in Qdrant collection.


query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
found_docs = qdrant.similarity_search(query)













print(found_docs[0].page_content)











Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. 

Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. 

One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. 

And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.













Similarity search with score#
Sometimes we might want to perform the search, but also obtain a relevancy score to know how good is a particular result.
The returned distance score is cosine distance. Therefore, a lower score is better.


query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
found_docs = qdrant.similarity_search_with_score(query)













document, score = found_docs[0]
print(document.page_content)
print(f""\nScore: {score}"")

Score: 0.8153784913324512












Metadata filtering#
Qdrant has an extensive filtering system with rich type support. It is also possible to use the filters in Langchain, by passing an additional param to both the similarity_search_with_score and similarity_search methods.
from qdrant_client.http import models as rest

query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
found_docs = qdrant.similarity_search_with_score(query, filter=rest.Filter(...))












Maximum marginal relevance search (MMR)#
If you’d like to look up for some similar documents, but you’d also like to receive diverse results, MMR is method you should consider. Maximal marginal relevance optimizes for similarity to query AND diversity among selected documents.


query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
found_docs = qdrant.max_marginal_relevance_search(query, k=2, fetch_k=10)













for i, doc in enumerate(found_docs):
print(f""{i + 1}."", doc.page_content, ""\n"")











1. Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections.

2. We can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves. 

I’ve worked on these issues a long time. 

I know what works: Investing in crime preventionand community police officers who’ll walk the beat, who’ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety. 













Qdrant as a Retriever#
Qdrant, as all the other vector stores, is a LangChain Retriever, by using cosine similarity.


retriever = qdrant.as_retriever()
retriever











VectorStoreRetriever(vectorstore=<langchain.vectorstores.qdrant.Qdrant object at 0x7fc4e5720a00>, search_type='similarity', search_kwargs={})











It might be also specified to use MMR as a search strategy, instead of similarity.


retriever = qdrant.as_retriever(search_type=""mmr"")
retriever











VectorStoreRetriever(vectorstore=<langchain.vectorstores.qdrant.Qdrant object at 0x7fc4e5720a00>, search_type='mmr', search_kwargs={})













query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)[0]

Customizing Qdrant#
Qdrant stores your vector embeddings along with the optional JSON-like payload. Payloads are optional, but since LangChain assumes the embeddings are generated from the documents, we keep the context data, so you can extract the original texts as well.
By default, your document is going to be stored in the following payload structure:
{
""page_content"": ""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"",
""metadata"": {
""foo"": ""bar""
}
}









You can, however, decide to use different keys for the page content and metadata. That’s useful if you already have a collection that you’d like to reuse. You can always change the


Qdrant.from_documents(
docs, embeddings, 
location="":memory:"",
collection_name=""my_documents_2"",
content_payload_key=""my_page_content_key"",
metadata_payload_key=""my_meta"",
)

Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. 

One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. 

And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.

OpenSearch is a scalable, flexible, and extensible open-source software suite for search, analytics, and observability applications licensed under Apache 2.0. OpenSearch is a distributed search and analytics engine based on Apache Lucene.

This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the OpenSearch database.
To run, you should have an OpenSearch instance up and running: see here for an easy Docker installation.
similarity_search by default performs the Approximate k-NN Search which uses one of the several algorithms like lucene, nmslib, faiss recommended for
large datasets. To perform brute force search we have other search methods known as Script Scoring and Painless Scripting.
Check this for more details.

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves. 

I’ve worked on these issues a long time. 

I know what works: Investing in crime preventionand community police officers who’ll walk the beat, who’ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety. 

So let’s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice. 

Let’s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable. 

That’s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers. 

That’s why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 Billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption—trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope.

We should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities. 

I ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.

And I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home—they have no serial numbers and can’t be traced. 

And I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon? 

Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. 

Repeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued. 

These laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives. 

The most fundamental right in America is the right to vote – and to have it counted. And it’s under assault. 

In state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections. 

We cannot let this happen. 

Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. 

Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. 

One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. 

And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence. 

A former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support—from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. 

And if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. 

We can do both. At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.

We’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.

We’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster.

One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. 

And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.












Similarity Search with score#
There are some FAISS specific methods. One of them is similarity_search_with_score, which allows you to return not only the documents but also the distance score of the query to them. The returned distance score is L2 distance. Therefore, a lower score is better.


docs_and_scores = db.similarity_search_with_score(query)













docs_and_scores[0]











(Document(page_content='In state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections. \n\nWe cannot let this happen. \n\nTonight.

 0.3914415)











It is also possible to do a search for documents similar to a given embedding vector using similarity_search_by_vector which accepts an embedding vector as a parameter instead of a string.


embedding_vector = embeddings.embed_query(query)
docs_and_scores = db.similarity_search_by_vector(embedding_vector)













Saving and loading#
You can also save and load a FAISS index. This is useful so you don’t have to recreate it everytime you use it.


db.save_local(""faiss_index"")













new_db = FAISS.load_local(""faiss_index"", embeddings)













docs = new_db.similarity_search(query)

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/vectorstores/examples/elasticsearch.html,"ElasticSearch#

Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents.

This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the Elasticsearch database.


ElasticVectorSearch class#

Installation#
Check out Elasticsearch installation instructions.
To connect to an Elasticsearch instance that does not require
login credentials, pass the Elasticsearch URL and index name along with the
embedding object to the constructor.
Example:
from langchain import ElasticVectorSearch
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings()
elastic_vector_search = ElasticVectorSearch(
elasticsearch_url=""http://localhost:9200"",
index_name=""test_index"",
embedding=embedding
)









To connect to an Elasticsearch instance that requires login credentials,
including Elastic Cloud, use the Elasticsearch URL format
https://username:password@es_host:9243. For example, to connect to Elastic
Cloud, create the Elasticsearch URL with the required authentication details and
pass it to the ElasticVectorSearch constructor as the named parameter
elasticsearch_url.
You can obtain your Elastic Cloud URL and login credentials by logging in to the
Elastic Cloud console at https://cloud.elastic.co, selecting your deployment, and
navigating to the “Deployments” page.
To obtain your Elastic Cloud password for the default “elastic” user:

Log in to the Elastic Cloud console at https://cloud.elastic.co
Go to “Security” > “Users”
Locate the “elastic” user and click “Edit”
Click “Reset password”
Follow the prompts to reset the password

Format for Elastic Cloud URLs is
https://username:password@cluster_id.region_id.gcp.cloud.es.io:9243.
Example:
from langchain import ElasticVectorSearch
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings()

elastic_host = ""cluster_id.region_id.gcp.cloud.es.io""
elasticsearch_url = f""https://username:password@{elastic_host}:9243""
elastic_vector_search = ElasticVectorSearch(
elasticsearch_url=elasticsearch_url,
index_name=""test_index"",
embedding=embedding
)











!pip install elasticsearch

Persistance#
The below steps cover how to persist a ChromaDB instance

Initialize PeristedChromaDB#
Create embeddings for each chunk and insert into the Chroma vector database. The persist_directory argument tells ChromaDB where to store the database when it’s persisted.


# Embed and store the texts
# Supplying a persist_directory will store the embeddings on disk
persist_directory = 'db'

embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents=docs, embedding=embedding, persist_directory=persist_directory)











Running Chroma using direct local API.
No existing DB found in db, skipping load
No existing DB found in db, skipping load













Persist the Database#
We should call persist() to ensure the embeddings are written to disk.


vectordb.persist()
vectordb = None











Persisting DB to disk, putting it in the save folder db
PersistentDuckDB del, about to run persist
Persisting DB to disk, putting it in the save folder db













Load the Database from disk, and create the chain#
Be sure to pass the same persist_directory and embedding_function as you did when you instantiated the database. Initialize the chain we will use for question answering.


# Now we can load the persisted database from disk, and use it as normal. 
vectordb = Chroma(persist_directory=persist_directory, embedding_function=embedding)











Running Chroma using direct local API.

loaded in 1 collections














Retriever options#
This section goes over different options for how to use Chroma as a retriever.

MMR#
In addition to using similarity search in the retriever object, you can also use mmr.


retriever = db.as_retriever(search_type=""mmr"")













retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)[0]

One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.', metadata={'source': '../../../state_of_the_union.txt'})














Updating a Document#
The update_document function allows you to modify the content of a document in the Chroma instance after it has been added. Let’s see an example of how to use this function.


# Import Document class
from langchain.docstore.document import Document

# Initial document content and id
initial_content = ""This is an initial document content""
document_id = ""doc1""

# Create an instance of Document with initial content and metadata
original_doc = Document(page_content=initial_content, metadata={""page"": ""0""})

# Initialize a Chroma instance with the original document
new_db = Chroma.from_documents(
collection_name=""test_collection"",
documents=[original_doc],
embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings(),# using the same embeddings as before
ids=[document_id],
)











At this point, we have a new Chroma instance with a single document “This is an initial document content” with id “doc1”. Now, let’s update the content of the document.


# Updated document content
updated_content = ""This is the updated document content""

# Create a new Document instance with the updated content
updated_doc = Document(page_content=updated_content, metadata={""page"": ""1""})

# Update the document in the Chroma instance by passing the document id and the updated document
new_db.update_document(document_id=document_id, document=updated_doc)

# Now, let's retrieve the updated document using similarity search
output = new_db.similarity_search(updated_content, k=1)

# Print the content of the retrieved document
print(output[0].page_content, output[0].metadata)











This is the updated document content {'page': '1'}

Add texts#
You can easily add text to a vectorstore with the add_texts method. It will return a list of document IDs (in case you need to use them downstream).


docsearch.add_texts([""Ankush went to Princeton""])

From Documents#
We can also initialize a vectorstore from documents directly. This is useful when we use the method on the text splitter to get documents directly (handy when the original documents have associated metadata).


documents = text_splitter.create_documents([state_of_the_union], metadatas=[{""source"": ""State of the Union""}])

This text splitter is the recommended one for generic text. It is parameterized by a list of characters. It tries to split on them in order until the chunks are small enough. The default list is [""\n\n"", ""\n"", "" "", """"]. This has the effect of trying to keep all paragraphs (and then sentences, and then words) together as long as possible, as those would generically seem to be the strongest semantically related pieces of text.

\section{Introduction}
Large language models (LLMs) are a type of machine learning model that can be trained on vast amounts of text data to generate human-like language. In recent years, LLMs have made significant advances in a variety of natural language processing tasks, including language translation, text generation, and sentiment analysis.

\subsection{History of LLMs}
The earliest LLMs were developed in the 1980s and 1990s, but they were limited by the amount of data that could be processed and the computational power available at the time. In the past decade, however, advances in hardware and software have made it possible to train LLMs on massive datasets, leading to significant improvements in performance.

\subsection{Applications of LLMs}
LLMs have many applications in industry, including chatbots, content creation, and virtual assistants. They can also be used in academia for research in linguistics, psychology, and computational linguistics.

The default recommended text splitter is the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter. This text splitter takes a list of characters. It tries to create chunks based on splitting on the first character, but if any chunks are too large it then moves onto the next character, and so forth. By default the characters it tries to split on are [""\n\n"", ""\n"", "" "", """"]
In addition to controlling which characters you can split on, you can also control a few other things:

length_function: how the length of chunks is calculated. Defaults to just counting number of characters, but it’s pretty common to pass a token counter here.
chunk_size: the maximum size of your chunks (as measured by the length function).
chunk_overlap: the maximum overlap between chunks. It can be nice to have some overlap to maintain some continuity between chunks (eg do a sliding window).

Note
Conceptual Guide

When you want to deal with long pieces of text, it is necessary to split up that text into chunks.
As simple as this sounds, there is a lot of potential complexity here. Ideally, you want to keep the semantically related pieces of text together. What “semantically related” means could depend on the type of text.
This notebook showcases several ways to do that.
At a high level, text splitters work as following:

Split the text up into small, semantically meaningful chunks (often sentences).
Start combining these small chunks into a larger chunk until you reach a certain size (as measured by some function).
Once you reach that size, make that chunk its own piece of text and then start creating a new chunk of text with some overlap (to keep context between chunks).

That means there are two different axes along which you can customize your text splitter:

How the text is split
How the chunk size is measured

For an introduction to the default text splitter and generic functionality see:


Getting Started


Usage examples for the text splitters:

Character
Code (including HTML, Markdown, Latex, Python, etc)
NLTK
Recursive Character
spaCy
tiktoken (OpenAI)



Most LLMs are constrained by the number of tokens that you can pass in, which is not the same as the number of characters.
In order to get a more accurate estimate, we can use tokenizers to count the number of tokens in the text.
We use this number inside the ..TextSplitter classes.
This implemented as the from_<tokenizer> methods of the ..TextSplitter classes:

Twitter is an online social media and social networking service.

This loader fetches the text from the Tweets of a list of Twitter users, using the tweepy Python package.
You must initialize the loader with your Twitter API token, and you need to pass in the Twitter username you want to extract.

## Welcome to LangChain [\#](\#welcome-to-langchain ""Permalink to this headline"")

**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model, but will also be:

1. _Data-aware_: connect a language model to other sources of data

2. _Agentic_: allow a language model to interact with its environment


The LangChain framework is designed around these principles.

This is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely conceptual guide to LangChain, see [here](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/). For the JavaScript documentation, see [here](https://js.langchain.com/docs/).

## Getting Started [\#](\#getting-started ""Permalink to this headline"")

How to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.

- [Quickstart Guide](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/getting_started/getting_started.html)


Concepts and terminology.

- [Concepts and terminology](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/getting_started/concepts.html)


Tutorials created by community experts and presented on YouTube.

- [Tutorials](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/getting_started/tutorials.html)


## Modules [\#](\#modules ""Permalink to this headline"")

These modules are the core abstractions which we view as the building blocks of any LLM-powered application.

For each module LangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces. LanghChain also provides external integrations and even end-to-end implementations for off-the-shelf use.

The docs for each module contain quickstart examples, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.

The modules are (from least to most complex):

- [Models](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/models.html): Supported model types and integrations.

- [Prompts](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/prompts.html): Prompt management, optimization, and serialization.

- [Memory](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/memory.html): Memory refers to state that is persisted between calls of a chain/agent.

- [Indexes](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes.html): Language models become much more powerful when combined with application-specific data - this module contains interfaces and integrations for loading, querying and updating external data.

- [Chains](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains.html): Chains are structured sequences of calls (to an LLM or to a different utility).

- [Agents](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents.html): An agent is a Chain in which an LLM, given a high-level directive and a set of tools, repeatedly decides an action, executes the action and observes the outcome until the high-level directive is complete.

- [Callbacks](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/callbacks/getting_started.html): Callbacks let you log and stream the intermediate steps of any chain, making it easy to observe, debug, and evaluate the internals of an application.


## Use Cases [\#](\#use-cases ""Permalink to this headline"")

Best practices and built-in implementations for common LangChain use cases:

- [Autonomous Agents](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/autonomous_agents.html): Autonomous agents are long-running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.

- [Agent Simulations](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/agent_simulations.html): Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other and react to events can be an effective way to evaluate their long-range reasoning and planning abilities.

- [Personal Assistants](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/personal_assistants.html): One of the primary LangChain use cases. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.

- [Question Answering](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/question_answering.html): Another common LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.

- [Chatbots](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/chatbots.html): Language models love to chat, making this a very natural use of them.

- [Querying Tabular Data](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/tabular.html): Recommended reading if you want to use language models to query structured data (CSVs, SQL, dataframes, etc).

- [Code Understanding](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/code.html): Recommended reading if you want to use language models to analyze code.

- [Interacting with APIs](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/apis.html): Enabling language models to interact with APIs is extremely powerful. It gives them access to up-to-date information and allows them to take actions.

- [Extraction](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/extraction.html): Extract structured information from text.

- [Summarization](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/summarization.html): Compressing longer documents. A type of Data-Augmented Generation.

- [Evaluation](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/evaluation.html): Generative models are hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One promising approach is to use language models themselves to do the evaluation.


## Reference Docs [\#](\#reference-docs ""Permalink to this headline"")

Full documentation on all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for LangChain.

- [Reference Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/reference.html)


## LangChain Ecosystem [\#](\#langchain-ecosystem ""Permalink to this headline"")

Guides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain.

- [LangChain Ecosystem](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/ecosystem.html)


## Additional Resources [\#](\#additional-resources ""Permalink to this headline"")

Additional resources we think may be useful as you develop your application!

- [LangChainHub](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain-hub): The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.

- [Gallery](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/additional_resources/gallery.html): A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.

Spreedly is a service that allows you to securely store credit cards and use them to transact against any number of payment gateways and third party APIs. It does this by simultaneously providing a card tokenization/vault service as well as a gateway and receiver integration service. Payment methods tokenized by Spreedly are stored at Spreedly, allowing you to independently store a card and then pass that card to different end points based on your business requirements.

This notebook covers how to load data from the Spreedly REST API into a format that can be ingested into LangChain, along with example usage for vectorization.
Note: this notebook assumes the following packages are installed: openai, chromadb, and tiktoken.

Prerequisites#

Follow the Quick Start section in this document
Log into the Psychic dashboard and get your secret key
Install the frontend react library into your web app and have a user authenticate a connection. The connection will be created using the connection id that you specify.



Loading documents#
Use the PsychicLoader class to load in documents from a connection. Each connection has a connector id (corresponding to the SaaS app that was connected) and a connection id (which you passed in to the frontend library).


# Uncomment this to install psychicapi if you don't already have it installed

Notion is a collaboration platform with modified Markdown support that integrates kanban boards, tasks, wikis and databases. It is an all-in-one workspace for notetaking, knowledge and data management, and project and task management.

NotionDBLoader is a Python class for loading content from a Notion database. It retrieves pages from the database, reads their content, and returns a list of Document objects.

Requirements#

A Notion Database
Notion Integration Token



Setup#

1. Create a Notion Table Database#
Create a new table database in Notion. You can add any column to the database and they will be treated as metadata. For example you can add the following columns:

Title: set Title as the default property.
Categories: A Multi-select property to store categories associated with the page.
Keywords: A Multi-select property to store keywords associated with the page.

Add your content to the body of each page in the database. The NotionDBLoader will extract the content and metadata from these pages.



2. Create a Notion Integration#
To create a Notion Integration, follow these steps:

Visit the Notion Developers page and log in with your Notion account.
Click on the “+ New integration” button.
Give your integration a name and choose the workspace where your database is located.
Select the require capabilities, this extension only need the Read content capability
Click the “Submit” button to create the integration.
Once the integration is created, you’ll be provided with an Integration Token (API key). Copy this token and keep it safe, as you’ll need it to use the NotionDBLoader.


3. Connect the Integration to the Database#
To connect your integration to the database, follow these steps:

Open your database in Notion.
Click on the three-dot menu icon in the top right corner of the database view.
Click on the “+ New integration” button.
Find your integration, you may need to start typing its name in the search box.
Click on the “Connect” button to connect the integration to the database.



4. Get the Database ID#
To get the database ID, follow these steps:

Open your database in Notion.
Click on the three-dot menu icon in the top right corner of the database view.
Select “Copy link” from the menu to copy the database URL to your clipboard.
The database ID is the long string of alphanumeric characters found in the URL. It typically looks like this: https://www.notion.so/username/8935f9d140a04f95a872520c4f123456?v=…. In this example, the database ID is 8935f9d140a04f95a872520c4f123456.

With the database properly set up and the integration token and database ID in hand, you can now use the NotionDBLoader code to load content and metadata from your Notion database.



Usage#
NotionDBLoader is part of the langchain package’s document loaders. You can use it as follows:


from getpass import getpass
NOTION_TOKEN = getpass()
DATABASE_ID = getpass()











········
········













from langchain.document_loaders import NotionDBLoader

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/document_loaders/examples/microsoft_onedrive.html,"Microsoft OneDrive#

Microsoft OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) is a file hosting service operated by Microsoft.

This notebook covers how to load documents from OneDrive. Currently, only docx, doc, and pdf files are supported.

Prerequisites#

Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform instructions.
When registration finishes, the Azure portal displays the app registration’s Overview pane. You see the Application (client) ID. Also called the client ID, this value uniquely identifies your application in the Microsoft identity platform.
During the steps you will be following at item 1, you can set the redirect URI as http://localhost:8000/callback
During the steps you will be following at item 1, generate a new password (client_secret) under Application Secrets section.
Follow the instructions at this document to add the following SCOPES (offline_access and Files.Read.All) to your application.
Visit the Graph Explorer Playground to obtain your OneDrive ID. The first step is to ensure you are logged in with the account associated your OneDrive account. Then you need to make a request to https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/drive and the response will return a payload with a field id that holds the ID of your OneDrive account.
You need to install the o365 package using the command pip install o365.
At the end of the steps you must have the following values:


CLIENT_ID
CLIENT_SECRET
DRIVE_ID



🧑 Instructions for ingesting your documents from OneDrive#

🔑 Authentication#
By default, the OneDriveLoader expects that the values of CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET must be stored as environment variables named O365_CLIENT_ID and O365_CLIENT_SECRET respectively. You could pass those environment variables through a .env file at the root of your application or using the following command in your script.
os.environ['O365_CLIENT_ID'] = ""YOUR CLIENT ID""
os.environ['O365_CLIENT_SECRET'] = ""YOUR CLIENT SECRET""









This loader uses an authentication called on behalf of a user. It is a 2 step authentication with user consent. When you instantiate the loader, it will call will print a url that the user must visit to give consent to the app on the required permissions. The user must then visit this url and give consent to the application. Then the user must copy the resulting page url and paste it back on the console. The method will then return True if the login attempt was succesful.
from langchain.document_loaders.onedrive import OneDriveLoader

loader = OneDriveLoader(drive_id=""YOUR DRIVE ID"")









Once the authentication has been done, the loader will store a token (o365_token.txt) at ~/.credentials/ folder. This token could be used later to authenticate without the copy/paste steps explained earlier. To use this token for authentication, you need to change the auth_with_token parameter to True in the instantiation of the loader.
from langchain.document_loaders.onedrive import OneDriveLoader

loader = OneDriveLoader(drive_id=""YOUR DRIVE ID"", auth_with_token=True)











🗂️ Documents loader#

📑 Loading documents from a OneDrive Directory#
OneDriveLoader can load documents from a specific folder within your OneDrive. For instance, you want to load all documents that are stored at Documents/clients folder within your OneDrive.
from langchain.document_loaders.onedrive import OneDriveLoader

loader = OneDriveLoader(drive_id=""YOUR DRIVE ID"", folder_path=""Documents/clients"", auth_with_token=True)
documents = loader.load()











📑 Loading documents from a list of Documents IDs#
Another possibility is to provide a list of object_id for each document you want to load. For that, you will need to query the Microsoft Graph API to find all the documents ID that you are interested in. This link provides a list of endpoints that will be helpful to retrieve the documents ID.
For instance, to retrieve information about all objects that are stored at the root of the Documents folder, you need make a request to: https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/drives/{YOUR DRIVE ID}/root/children. Once you have the list of IDs that you are interested in, then you can instantiate the loader with the following parameters.
from langchain.document_loaders.onedrive import OneDriveLoader

loader = OneDriveLoader(drive_id=""YOUR DRIVE ID"", object_ids=[""ID_1"", ""ID_2""], auth_with_token=True)
documents = loader.load()

Joplin is an open source note-taking app. Capture your thoughts and securely access them from any device.

This notebook covers how to load documents from a Joplin database.
Joplin has a REST API for accessing its local database. This loader uses the API to retrieve all notes in the database and their metadata. This requires an access token that can be obtained from the app by following these steps:

Open the Joplin app. The app must stay open while the documents are being loaded.
Go to settings / options and select “Web Clipper”.
Make sure that the Web Clipper service is enabled.
Under “Advanced Options”, copy the authorization token.

You may either initialize the loader directly with the access token, or store it in the environment variable JOPLIN_ACCESS_TOKEN.
An alternative to this approach is to export the Joplin’s note database to Markdown files (optionally, with Front Matter metadata) and use a Markdown loader, such as ObsidianLoader, to load them.

loader = JoplinLoader(access_token=""<access-token>"")

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/document_loaders/examples/docugami.html,"Docugami#
This notebook covers how to load documents from Docugami. It provides the advantages of using this system over alternative data loaders.

Prerequisites#

Install necessary python packages.
Grab an access token for your workspace, and make sure it is set as the DOCUGAMI_API_KEY environment variable.
Grab some docset and document IDs for your processed documents, as described here: https://help.docugami.com/home/docugami-api



# You need the lxml package to use the DocugamiLoader
!pip install lxml













Quick start#

Create a Docugami workspace (free trials available)
Add your documents (PDF, DOCX or DOC) and allow Docugami to ingest and cluster them into sets of similar documents, e.g. NDAs, Lease Agreements, and Service Agreements. There is no fixed set of document types supported by the system, the clusters created depend on your particular documents, and you can change the docset assignments later.
Create an access token via the Developer Playground for your workspace. Detailed instructions
Explore the Docugami API to get a list of your processed docset IDs, or just the document IDs for a particular docset.
Use the DocugamiLoader as detailed below, to get rich semantic chunks for your documents.
Optionally, build and publish one or more reports or abstracts. This helps Docugami improve the semantic XML with better tags based on your preferences, which are then added to the DocugamiLoader output as metadata. Use techniques like self-querying retriever to do high accuracy Document QA.



Advantages vs Other Chunking Techniques#
Appropriate chunking of your documents is critical for retrieval from documents. Many chunking techniques exist, including simple ones that rely on whitespace and recursive chunk splitting based on character length. Docugami offers a different approach:

Intelligent Chunking: Docugami breaks down every document into a hierarchical semantic XML tree of chunks of varying sizes, from single words or numerical values to entire sections. These chunks follow the semantic contours of the document, providing a more meaningful representation than arbitrary length or simple whitespace-based chunking.
Structured Representation: In addition, the XML tree indicates the structural contours of every document, using attributes denoting headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and other common elements, and does that consistently across all supported document formats, such as scanned PDFs or DOCX files. It appropriately handles long-form document characteristics like page headers/footers or multi-column flows for clean text extraction.
Semantic Annotations: Chunks are annotated with semantic tags that are coherent across the document set, facilitating consistent hierarchical queries across multiple documents, even if they are written and formatted differently. For example, in set of lease agreements, you can easily identify key provisions like the Landlord, Tenant, or Renewal Date, as well as more complex information such as the wording of any sub-lease provision or whether a specific jurisdiction has an exception section within a Termination Clause.
Additional Metadata: Chunks are also annotated with additional metadata, if a user has been using Docugami. This additional metadata can be used for high-accuracy Document QA without context window restrictions. See detailed code walk-through below.



import os
from langchain.document_loaders import DocugamiLoader













Load Documents#
If the DOCUGAMI_API_KEY environment variable is set, there is no need to pass it in to the loader explicitly otherwise you can pass it in as the access_token parameter.


DOCUGAMI_API_KEY=os.environ.get('DOCUGAMI_API_KEY')

# To load all docs in the given docset ID, just don't provide document_ids
loader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id=""ecxqpipcoe2p"", document_ids=[""43rj0ds7s0ur""])

The metadata for each Document (really, a chunk of an actual PDF, DOC or DOCX) contains some useful additional information:

id and name: ID and Name of the file (PDF, DOC or DOCX) the chunk is sourced from within Docugami.
xpath: XPath inside the XML representation of the document, for the chunk. Useful for source citations directly to the actual chunk inside the document XML.
structure: Structural attributes of the chunk, e.g. h1, h2, div, table, td, etc. Useful to filter out certain kinds of chunks if needed by the caller.
tag: Semantic tag for the chunk, using various generative and extractive techniques. More details here: https://github.com/docugami/DFM-benchmarks



Basic Use: Docugami Loader for Document QA#
You can use the Docugami Loader like a standard loader for Document QA over multiple docs, albeit with much better chunks that follow the natural contours of the document. There are many great tutorials on how to do this, e.g. this one. We can just use the same code, but use the DocugamiLoader for better chunking, instead of loading text or PDF files directly with basic splitting techniques.


!poetry run pip -q install openai tiktoken chromadb













from langchain.schema import Document
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

# For this example, we already have a processed docset for a set of lease documents
loader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id=""wh2kned25uqm"")
documents = loader.load()











The documents returned by the loader are already split, so we don’t need to use a text splitter. Optionally, we can use the metadata on each document, for example the structure or tag attributes, to do any post-processing we want.
We will just use the output of the DocugamiLoader as-is to set up a retrieval QA chain the usual way.


embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents=documents, embedding=embedding)
retriever = vectordb.as_retriever()
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
llm=OpenAI(), chain_type=""stuff"", retriever=retriever, return_source_documents=True
)











Using embedded DuckDB without persistence: data will be transient













# Try out the retriever with an example query
qa_chain(""What can tenants do with signage on their properties?"")











{'query': 'What can tenants do with signage on their properties?',
 'result': ' Tenants may place signs (digital or otherwise) or other form of identification on the premises after receiving written permission from the landlord which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The tenant is responsible for any damage caused to the premises and must conform to any applicable laws, ordinances, etc. governing the same.

Using Docugami to Add Metadata to Chunks for High Accuracy Document QA#
One issue with large documents is that the correct answer to your question may depend on chunks that are far apart in the document. Typical chunking techniques, even with overlap, will struggle with providing the LLM sufficent context to answer such questions. With upcoming very large context LLMs, it may be possible to stuff a lot of tokens, perhaps even entire documents, inside the context but this will still hit limits at some point with very long documents, or a lot of documents.
For example, if we ask a more complex question that requires the LLM to draw on chunks from different parts of the document, even OpenAI’s powerful LLM is unable to answer correctly.


chain_response = qa_chain(""What is rentable area for the property owned by DHA Group?"")
chain_response[""result""]# the correct answer should be 13,500











' 9,753 square feet'











At first glance the answer may seem reasonable, but if you review the source chunks carefully for this answer, you will see that the chunking of the document did not end up putting the Landlord name and the rentable area in the same context, since they are far apart in the document. The retriever therefore ends up finding unrelated chunks from other documents not even related to the Menlo Group landlord. That landlord happens to be mentioned on the first page of the file Shorebucks LLC_NJ.pdf file, and while one of the source chunks used by the chain is indeed from that doc that contains the correct answer (13,500), other source chunks from different docs are included, and the answer is therefore incorrect.

Docugami can help here. Chunks are annotated with additional metadata created using different techniques if a user has been using Docugami. More technical approaches will be added later.
Specifically, let’s look at the additional metadata that is returned on the documents returned by docugami, in the form of some simple key/value pairs on all the text chunks:


loader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id=""wh2kned25uqm"")
documents = loader.load()
documents[0].metadata











{'xpath': '/docset:OFFICELEASEAGREEMENT-section/docset:OFFICELEASEAGREEMENT/docset:ThisOfficeLeaseAgreement',
 'id': 'v1bvgaozfkak',
 'name': 'TruTone Lane 2.docx',
 'structure': 'p',
 'tag': 'ThisOfficeLeaseAgreement',
 'Landlord': 'BUBBA CENTER PARTNERSHIP',
 'Tenant': 'Truetone Lane LLC'}











We can use a self-querying retriever to improve our query accuracy, using this additional metadata:


from langchain.chains.query_constructor.schema import AttributeInfo
from langchain.retrievers.self_query.base import SelfQueryRetriever

EXCLUDE_KEYS = [""id"", ""xpath"", ""structure""]
metadata_field_info = [
AttributeInfo(
name=key,
description=f""The {key} for this chunk"",
type=""string"",
)
for key in documents[0].metadata
if key.lower() not in EXCLUDE_KEYS
]


document_content_description = ""Contents of this chunk""
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents=documents, embedding=embedding)
retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm(
llm, vectordb, document_content_description, metadata_field_info, verbose=True
)
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
llm=OpenAI(), chain_type=""stuff"", retriever=retriever, return_source_documents=True
)











Using embedded DuckDB without persistence: data will be transient











Let’s run the same question again. It returns the correct result since all the chunks have metadata key/value pairs on them carrying key information about the document even if this information is physically very far away from the source chunk used to generate the answer.


qa_chain(""What is rentable area for the property owned by DHA Group?"")











query='rentable area' filter=Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='Landlord', value='DHA Group')

This time the answer is correct, since the self-querying retriever created a filter on the landlord attribute of the metadata, correctly filtering to document that specifically is about the DHA Group landlord. The resulting source chunks are all relevant to this landlord, and this improves answer accuracy even though the landlord is not directly mentioned in the specific chunk that contains the correct answer."

Unlike traditional web scraping tools, Diffbot doesn’t require any rules to read the content on a page.
It starts with computer vision, which classifies a page into one of 20 possible types. Content is then interpreted by a machine learning model trained to identify the key attributes on a page based on its type.
The result is a website transformed into clean structured data (like JSON or CSV), ready for your application.

This covers how to extract HTML documents from a list of URLs using the Diffbot extract API, into a document format that we can use downstream.

[Document(page_content='LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\nBe data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data\nBe agentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely conceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see here.\nGetting Started\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.\nGetting Started Documentation\nModules\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for. For each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides. These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\nModels: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\nPrompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\nMemory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\nIndexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\nChains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\nAgents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\nUse Cases\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports.\nPersonal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\nQuestion Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\nChatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\nQuerying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\nInteracting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\nExtraction: Extract structured information from text.\nSummarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\nEvaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\nReference Docs\nAll of LangChain’s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation on all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for LangChain.\nReference Documentation\nLangChain Ecosystem\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\nLangChain Ecosystem\nAdditional Resources\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your application!\nLangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\nGlossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\nGallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\nDeployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\nTracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\nModel Laboratory: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\nDiscord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\nProduction Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we’d love to offer more comprehensive support.

Confluence is a wiki collaboration platform that saves and organizes all of the project-related material. Confluence is a knowledge base that primarily handles content management activities.

A loader for Confluence pages.
This currently supports username/api_key, Oauth2 login. Additionally, on-prem installations also support token authentication.
Specify a list page_id-s and/or space_key to load in the corresponding pages into Document objects, if both are specified the union of both sets will be returned.
You can also specify a boolean include_attachments to include attachments, this is set to False by default, if set to True all attachments will be downloaded and ConfluenceReader will extract the text from the attachments and add it to the Document object. Currently supported attachment types are: PDF, PNG, JPEG/JPG, SVG, Word and Excel.
Hint: space_key and page_id can both be found in the URL of a page in Confluence - https://yoursite.atlassian.com/wiki/spaces/<space_key>/pages/<page_id>
Before using ConfluenceLoader make sure you have the latest version of the atlassian-python-api package installed:


#!pip install atlassian-python-api













Examples#

Username and Password or Username and API Token (Atlassian Cloud only)#
This example authenticates using either a username and password or, if you’re connecting to an Atlassian Cloud hosted version of Confluence, a username and an API Token.
You can generate an API token at: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens.
The limit parameter specifies how many documents will be retrieved in a single call, not how many documents will be retrieved in total.
By default the code will return up to 1000 documents in 50 documents batches. To control the total number of documents use the max_pages parameter.
Plese note the maximum value for the limit parameter in the atlassian-python-api package is currently 100.

For more information on how to generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) check the official Confluence documentation at: https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/using-personal-access-tokens-1026032365.html.
When using a PAT you provide only the token value, you cannot provide a username.
Please note that ConfluenceLoader will run under the permissions of the user that generated the PAT and will only be able to load documents for which said user has access to.

Apify Dataset is a scaleable append-only storage with sequential access built for storing structured web scraping results, such as a list of products or Google SERPs, and then export them to various formats like JSON, CSV, or Excel. Datasets are mainly used to save results of Apify Actors—serverless cloud programs for varius web scraping, crawling, and data extraction use cases.

This notebook shows how to load Apify datasets to LangChain.

Prerequisites#
You need to have an existing dataset on the Apify platform. If you don’t have one, please first check out this notebook on how to use Apify to extract content from documentation, knowledge bases, help centers, or blogs.


#!pip install apify-client











First, import ApifyDatasetLoader into your source code:


from langchain.document_loaders import ApifyDatasetLoader
from langchain.document_loaders.base import Document











Then provide a function that maps Apify dataset record fields to LangChain Document format.
For example, if your dataset items are structured like this:
{
""url"": ""https://apify.com"",
""text"": ""Apify is the best web scraping and automation platform.""
}









The mapping function in the code below will convert them to LangChain Document format, so that you can use them further with any LLM model (e.g. for question answering).


loader = ApifyDatasetLoader(
dataset_id=""your-dataset-id"",
dataset_mapping_function=lambda dataset_item: Document(
page_content=dataset_item[""text""], metadata={""source"": dataset_item[""url""]}
),
)













data = loader.load()













An example with question answering#
In this example, we use data from a dataset to answer a question.


from langchain.docstore.document import Document
from langchain.document_loaders import ApifyDatasetLoader
from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator













loader = ApifyDatasetLoader(
dataset_id=""your-dataset-id"",
dataset_mapping_function=lambda item: Document(
page_content=item[""text""] or """", metadata={""source"": item[""url""]}
),
)













index = VectorstoreIndexCreator().from_loaders([loader])













query = ""What is Apify?""
result = index.query_with_sources(query)













print(result[""answer""])
print(result[""sources""])











 Apify is a platform for developing, running, and sharing serverless cloud programs. It enables users to create web scraping and automation tools and publish them on the Apify platform.

Airbyte is a data integration platform for ELT pipelines from APIs, databases & files to warehouses & lakes. It has the largest catalog of ELT connectors to data warehouses and databases.

This covers how to load any source from Airbyte into a local JSON file that can be read in as a document
Prereqs:
Have docker desktop installed
Steps:

Clone Airbyte from GitHub - git clone https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte.git
Switch into Airbyte directory - cd airbyte
Start Airbyte - docker compose up
In your browser, just visit http://localhost:8000. You will be asked for a username and password. By default, that’s username airbyte and password password.
Setup any source you wish.
Set destination as Local JSON, with specified destination path - lets say /json_data. Set up manual sync.
Run the connection.
To see what files are create, you can navigate to: file:///tmp/airbyte_local
Find your data and copy path. That path should be saved in the file variable below. It should start with /tmp/airbyte_local

Prerequisites#

Create a Google Cloud project or use an existing project
Enable the Youtube Api
Authorize credentials for desktop app
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib youtube-transcript-api



🧑 Instructions for ingesting your Google Docs data#
By default, the GoogleDriveLoader expects the credentials.json file to be ~/.credentials/credentials.json, but this is configurable using the credentials_file keyword argument. Same thing with token.json. Note that token.json will be created automatically the first time you use the loader.
GoogleApiYoutubeLoader can load from a list of Google Docs document ids or a folder id. You can obtain your folder and document id from the URL:
Note depending on your set up, the service_account_path needs to be set up. See here for more details.


from langchain.document_loaders import GoogleApiClient, GoogleApiYoutubeLoader

# Init the GoogleApiClient

This notebook shows how to load wiki pages from wikipedia.org into the Document format that we use downstream.

Installation#
First, you need to install wikipedia python package.


#!pip install wikipedia













Examples#
WikipediaLoader has these arguments:

query: free text which used to find documents in Wikipedia
optional lang: default=”en”. Use it to search in a specific language part of Wikipedia
optional load_max_docs: default=100. Use it to limit number of downloaded documents. It takes time to download all 100 documents, so use a small number for experiments. There is a hard limit of 300 for now.
optional load_all_available_meta: default=False. By default only the most important fields downloaded: Published (date when document was published/last updated), title, Summary. If True, other fields also downloaded.

[Document(page_content='# My iPhone 6 is typing and opening apps by itself\nmy iphone 6 is typing and opening apps by itself. How do i fix this. I just bought it last week.\nI restored as manufactures cleaned up the screen\nthe problem continues\n\n## 27 Answers\n\nFilter by: \n\nMost Helpful\nNewest\nOldest\n\n### Accepted Answer\nHi,\nWhere did you buy it? If you bought it from Apple or from an official retailer like Carphone warehouse etc. Then you\'ll have a year warranty and can get it replaced free.\nIf you bought it second hand, from a third part repair shop or online, then it may still have warranty, unless it is refurbished and has been repaired elsewhere.\nIf this is the case, it may be the screen that needs replacing to solve your issue.\nEither way, wherever you got it, it\'s best to return it and get a refund or a replacement device. :-)\n\n\n\n### Most Helpful Answer\nI had the same issues, screen freezing, opening apps by itself, selecting the screens and typing on it\'s own. I first suspected aliens and then ghosts and then hackers.\niPhone 6 is weak physically and tend to bend on pressure. And my phone had no case or cover.\nI took the phone to apple stores and they said sensors need to be replaced and possibly screen replacement as well. My phone is just 17 months old.\nHere is what I did two days ago and since then it is working like a charm..\nHold the phone in portrait (as if watching a movie). Twist it very very gently. do it few times.Rest the phone for 10 mins (put it on a flat surface). You can now notice those self typing things gone and screen getting stabilized.\nThen, reset the hardware (hold the power and home button till the screen goes off and comes back with apple logo). release the buttons when you see this.\nThen, connect to your laptop and log in to iTunes and reset your phone completely. (please take a back-up first).\nAnd your phone should be good to use again.\nWhat really happened here for me is that the sensors might have stuck to the screen and with mild twisting, they got disengaged/released.\nI posted this in Apple Community and the moderators deleted it, for the best reasons known to them.\nInstead of throwing away your phone (or selling cheaply), try this and you could be saving your phone.\nLet me know how it goes.\n\n\n\n### Other Answer\nIt was the charging cord! I bought a gas station braided cord and it was the culprit. Once I plugged my OEM cord into the phone the GHOSTS went away.\n\n\n\n### Other Answer\nI\'ve same issue that I just get resolved.I first tried to restore it from iCloud back, however it was not a software issue or any virus issue, so after restore same problem continues. Then I get my phone to local area iphone repairing lab, and they detected that it is an LCD issue. LCD get out of order without any reason (It was neither hit or nor slipped, but LCD get out of order all and sudden, while using it) it started opening things at random. I get LCD replaced with new one, that cost me $80.00 in total($70.00 LCD charges + $10.00 as labor charges to fix it). iPhone is back to perfect mode now.It was iphone 6s. Thanks.\n\n\n\n### Other Answer\nI was having the same issue with my 6 plus, I took it to a repair shop, they opened the phone, disconnected the three ribbons the screen has, blew up and cleaned the connectors and connected the screen again and it solved the issue… it’s hardware, not software.\n\n\n\n### Other Answer\nHey.\nJust had this problem now. As it turns out, you just need to plug in your phone. I use a case and when I took it off I noticed that there was a lot of dust and dirt around the areas that the case didn\'t cover. I shined a light in my ports and noticed they were filled with dust. Tomorrow I plan on using pressurized air to clean it out and the problem should be solved.If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\n\n\n\n### Other Answer\nI simply changed the power supply and problem was gone. The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\n\n\n\n### Other Answer\nSomeone ask!I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t.Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case.I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping!Bullshit!!I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new!Never dropped or abused any way!I have my original charger.I am going to clean it and try everyone’s advice.It really sucks!I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots!I play every day.I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max.It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self.It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\n\n\n\n### Other Answer\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\'s what the ""plus"" in ""6 plus"" refers to?).An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble.If it didn\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168!Of couese the OS upgrade didn\'t fix the problem.Thanks for helping me figure out that it\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the ""genius"" probably knows too.\nI\'m getting ready to go Android.\n\n\n\n### Other Answer\nI experienced similar ghost touches.Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it’s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don’t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously).I’m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell,or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call.I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I’m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\n\n\n\n### Other Answer\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\n\n\n\n### Other Answer\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\n\n\n\n### Other Answer\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\n\n\n\n### Other Answer\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\n\n\n\n### Other Answer\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free!You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it.I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June.My iPad sept.Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill!Now this crap!!! Really\n\n\n\n### Other Answer\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus.While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode).My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose.Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now.I will of course keep you posted if this changes.Thanks to all for the helpful posts, really helped me narrow a few things down.\n\n\n\n### Other Answer\nWhen my phone was doing this, it ended up being the screen protector that i got from 5 below. I took it off and it stopped. I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\n\n\n\n### Other Answer\niPhone 6 Plus first generation….I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over….it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room…..I thought the phone was toast and i’d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room…..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plug…no more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves…..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug….until I changed the block plug.\n\n\n\n### Other Answer\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\n\n\n\n### Other Answer\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\n\n\n\n### Other Answer\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cable…or at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhone…not the $5 Store fast charging cables.My original cable is pretty beat up - like most that I see - but I’ve been beaten up much MUCH less by sticking with its use!I didn’t find that the casing/shell around it or not made any diff.\n\n\n\n### Other Answer\ngreat now I have to wait one more hour to reset my phone and while I was tryin to connect my phone to my computer the computer also restarted smh does anyone else knows how I can get my phone to work… my problem is I have a black dot on the bottom left of my screen an it wont allow me to touch a certain part of my screen unless I rotate my phone and I know the password but the first number is a 2 and it won\'t let me touch 1,2, or 3 so now I have to find a way to get rid of my password and all of a sudden my phone wants to touch stuff on its own which got my phone disabled many times to the point where I have to wait a whole hour and I really need to finish something on my phone today PLEASE HELPPPP\n\n\n\n### Other Answer\nIn my case , iphone 6 screen was faulty. I got it replaced at local repair shop, so far phone is working fine.\n\n\n\n### Other Answer\nthis problem in iphone 6 has many different scenarios and solutions, first try to reconnect the lcd screen to the motherboard again, if didnt solve, try to replace the lcd connector on the motherboard, if not solved, then remains two issues, lcd screen it self or touch IC. in my country some repair shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also have an issue in LCD connector on the motherboard, specially if you lock/unlock screen and screen works again for sometime. lcd connectors gets disconnected lightly from the motherboard due to multiple falls and hits after sometime. best of luck for all\n\n\n\n### Other Answer\nI am facing the same issue whereby these ghost touches type and open apps , I am using an original Iphone cable , how to I fix this issue.\n\n\n\n### Other Answer\nThere were two issues with the phone I had troubles with. It was my dads and turns out he carried it in his pocket. The phone itself had a little bend in it as a result. A little pressure in the opposite direction helped the issue.

[Document(page_content='I rented I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW from my video store because of all the controversy that surrounded it when it was first released in 1967. I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered ""controversial"" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\'s not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn\'t have much of a plot.', metadata={'label': 0}),
 Document(page_content='""I Am Curious: Yellow"" is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn\'t matter what one\'s political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn\'t true. I\'ve seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don\'t exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we\'re treated to the site of Vincent Gallo\'s throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) ""double-standard"" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won\'t see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women\'s bodies.', metadata={'label': 0}),

She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity.

 Document(page_content=""Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me."", metadata={'label': 0}),
 Document(page_content='When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York\'s portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York\'s portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement.<br /><br />To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He\'s small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky.<br /><br />Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS\' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, ""Before the Laughter"" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in ""Before the Laughter"" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.', metadata={'label': 0}),
 Document(page_content='Who are these ""They""- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn\'t be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It\'s the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot\x97 TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that\'s no fun to watch.<br /><br />Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character\'s status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I\'m-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat\'s-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple\'s respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich\'s daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on \'love\' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It\'s a movie and we can expect that much, if that\'s what you\'re looking for you\'d be better off picking up a copy of Vogue.<br /><br />Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie\'s title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20\'s may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. ""They All Laughed"" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes.<br /><br />Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn\'t prove popular. His rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of Hollywood stories, so there\'s no joy in criticizing the film... there _is_ real emotional investment in Ms. Stratten\'s scenes. But ""Laughed"" is a faint echo of ""The Last Picture Show"", ""Paper Moon"" or ""What\'s Up, Doc""- following ""Daisy Miller"" and ""At Long Last Love"", it was a thundering confirmation of the phase from which P.B. has never emerged.<br /><br />All in all, though, the movie is harmless, only a waste of rental.

 Document(page_content=""This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest."", metadata={'label': 0}),
 Document(page_content='It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing.<br /><br />Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn\'t go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn\'t think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role.<br /><br />The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, ""Cat\'s Meow"" and all his early ones from ""Targets"" to ""Nickleodeon"". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one.<br /><br />It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich\'s ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called ""Moonlighting"" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines.<br /><br />Bottom line: It ain\'t no ""Paper Moon"" and only a very pale version of ""What\'s Up, Doc"".', metadata={'label': 0}),
 Document(page_content=""I can't believe that those praising this movie herein aren't thinking of some other film.

Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn."", metadata={'label': 0}),

 Document(page_content='Today I found ""They All Laughed"" on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in ""Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003"" and \x96 wow \x96 four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching ""They All Laughed"" and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in ""Star 80"" and ""Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story""; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song ""Amigo"", from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60\'s and is called by his fans as ""The King"". I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten).

arXiv is an open-access archive for 2 million scholarly articles in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics.

This notebook shows how to load scientific articles from Arxiv.org into a document format that we can use downstream.

Installation#
First, you need to install arxiv python package.


#!pip install arxiv











Second, you need to install PyMuPDF python package which transforms PDF files downloaded from the arxiv.org site into the text format.


#!pip install pymupdf













Examples#
ArxivLoader has these arguments:

query: free text which used to find documents in the Arxiv
optional load_max_docs: default=100. Use it to limit number of downloaded documents. It takes time to download all 100 documents, so use a small number for experiments.
optional load_all_available_meta: default=False. By default only the most important fields downloaded: Published (date when document was published/last updated), Title, Authors, Summary. If True, other fields also downloaded.



from langchain.document_loaders import ArxivLoader













docs = ArxivLoader(query=""1605.08386"", load_max_docs=2).load()

Selenium URL Loader#
This covers how to load HTML documents from a list of URLs using the SeleniumURLLoader.
Using selenium allows us to load pages that require JavaScript to render.

Setup#
To use the SeleniumURLLoader, you will need to install selenium and unstructured.


from langchain.document_loaders import SeleniumURLLoader













urls = [
""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"",
""https://goo.gl/maps/NDSHwePEyaHMFGwh8""

loader = SeleniumURLLoader(urls=urls)













data = loader.load()














Playwright URL Loader#
This covers how to load HTML documents from a list of URLs using the PlaywrightURLLoader.
As in the Selenium case, Playwright allows us to load pages that need JavaScript to render.

Setup#
To use the PlaywrightURLLoader, you will need to install playwright and unstructured. Additionally, you will need to install the Playwright Chromium browser:


# Install playwright
!pip install ""playwright""
!pip install ""unstructured""
!playwright install













from langchain.document_loaders import PlaywrightURLLoader













urls = [
""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"",

Retain Elements#
Under the hood, Unstructured creates different “elements” for different chunks of text. By default we combine those together, but you can easily keep that separation by specifying mode=""elements"".

Define a Partitioning Strategy#
Unstructured document loader allow users to pass in a strategy parameter that lets unstructured know how to partition the document. Currently supported strategies are ""hi_res"" (the default) and ""fast"". Hi res partitioning strategies are more accurate, but take longer to process. Fast strategies partition the document more quickly, but trade-off accuracy. Not all document types have separate hi res and fast partitioning strategies. For those document types, the strategy kwarg is ignored. In some cases, the high res strategy will fallback to fast if there is a dependency missing (i.e. a model for document partitioning). You can see how to apply a strategy to an UnstructuredFileLoader below.

Processing PDF documents works exactly the same way. Unstructured detects the file type and extracts the same types of elements.

Unstructured API#
If you want to get up and running with less set up, you can simply run pip install unstructured and use UnstructuredAPIFileLoader or UnstructuredAPIFileIOLoader. That will process your document using the hosted Unstructured API. Note that currently (as of 11 May 2023) the Unstructured API is open, but it will soon require an API. The Unstructured documentation page will have instructions on how to generate an API key once they’re available. Check out the instructions here if you’d like to self-host the Unstructured API or run it locally.


from langchain.document_loaders import UnstructuredAPIFileLoader













filenames = [""example_data/fake.docx"", ""example_data/fake-email.eml""]

api_key=""FAKE_API_KEY"",
)













docs = loader.load()

Document(page_content='Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.', metadata={'source': 'example_data/fake.docx'})











You can also batch multiple files through the Unstructured API in a single API using UnstructuredAPIFileLoader.

The SubRip file format is described on the Matroska multimedia container format website as “perhaps the most basic of all subtitle formats.” SubRip (SubRip Text) files are named with the extension .srt, and contain formatted lines of plain text in groups separated by a blank line. Subtitles are numbered sequentially, starting at 1. The timecode format used is hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds with time units fixed to two zero-padded digits and fractions fixed to three zero-padded digits (00:00:00,000). The fractional separator used is the comma, since the program was written in France.

transformative technology, enabling\ndevelopers to build applications that they previously could not.\nBut using these LLMs in isolation is often not enough to\ncreate a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you are able to\ncombine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.\nThis library is aimed at assisting in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these types of applications include:\n❓ Question Answering over specific documents\n\nDocumentation\nEnd-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database\n\n💬 Chatbots\n\nDocumentation\nEnd-to-end Example: Chat-LangChain\n\n🤖 Agents\n\nDocumentation\nEnd-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha\n\n\nGetting Started#\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.\n\nGetting Started Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\nModules#\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for.\nFor each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.\nThese modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\n\nPrompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\nLLMs: This includes a generic interface for all LLMs, and common utilities for working with LLMs.\nDocument Loaders: This includes a standard interface for loading documents, as well as specific integrations to all types of text data sources.\nUtils: Language models are often more powerful when interacting with other sources of knowledge or computation. This can include Python REPLs, embeddings, search engines, and more. LangChain provides a large collection of common utils to use in your application.\nChains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\nIndexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\nAgents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\nMemory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\nChat: Chat models are a variation on Language Models that expose a different API - rather than working with raw text, they work with messages. LangChain provides a standard interface for working with them and doing all the same things as above.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Cases#\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports.\n\nAgents: Agents are systems that use a language model to interact with other tools. These can be used to do more grounded question/answering, interact with APIs, or even take actions.\nChatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\nData Augmented Generation: Data Augmented Generation involves specific types of chains that first interact with an external datasource to fetch data to use in the generation step. Examples of this include summarization of long pieces of text and question/answering over specific data sources.\nQuestion Answering: Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\nSummarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\nQuerying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\nEvaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\nGenerate similar examples: Generating similar examples to a given input. This is a common use case for many applications, and LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\nCompare models: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\nReference Docs#\nAll of LangChain’s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation on all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for LangChain.\n\nReference Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\nLangChain Ecosystem#\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\n\nLangChain Ecosystem\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Resources#\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your application!\n\nLangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\nGlossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\nGallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\nDeployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\nDiscord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\nTracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\nProduction Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we’d love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we’ll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnext\nQuickstart Guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Contents\n\n\n\nGetting Started\nModules\nUse Cases\nReference Docs\nLangChain Ecosystem\nAdditional Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Harrison Chase\n\n\n\n\n\n© Copyright 2023, Harrison Chase.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast updated on Mar 24, 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'https://python.langchain.com/en/stable/', 'loc': 'https://python.langchain.com/en/stable/', 'lastmod': '2023-03-24T19:30:54.647430+00:00', 'changefreq': 'weekly', 'priority': '1'}, lookup_index=0)












Filtering sitemap URLs#
Sitemaps can be massive files, with thousands of URLs.Often you don’t need every single one of them.You can filter the URLs by passing a list of strings or regex patterns to the url_filter parameter.Only URLs that match one of the patterns will be loaded.

\n\n\n\nGetting Started\nModules\nUse Cases\nReference Docs\nLangChain Ecosystem\nAdditional Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to LangChain#\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\n\nBe data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data\nBe agentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment\n\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely conceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see here.\n\nGetting Started#\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.\n\nGetting Started Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\nModules#\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for.\nFor each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.\nThese modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\n\nModels: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\nPrompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\nMemory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\nIndexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\nChains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\nAgents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Cases#\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports.\n\nPersonal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\nQuestion Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\nChatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\nQuerying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\nInteracting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\nExtraction: Extract structured information from text.\nSummarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\nEvaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\n\n\n\n\n\nReference Docs#\nAll of LangChain’s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation on all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for LangChain.\n\nReference Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\nLangChain Ecosystem#\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\n\nLangChain Ecosystem\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Resources#\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your application!\n\nLangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\nGlossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\nGallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\nDeployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\nTracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\nModel Laboratory: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\nDiscord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\nProduction Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we’d love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we’ll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnext\nQuickstart Guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Contents\n\n\n\nGetting Started\nModules\nUse Cases\nReference Docs\nLangChain Ecosystem\nAdditional Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Harrison Chase\n\n\n\n\n\n© Copyright 2023, Harrison Chase.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast updated on Mar 27, 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/', 'loc': 'https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/', 'lastmod': '2023-03-27T22:50:49.790324+00:00', 'changefreq': 'daily', 'priority': '0.9'}, lookup_index=0)

[Document(page_content='A WEAK ( k, k ) -LEFSCHETZ THEOREM FOR PROJECTIVE TORIC ORBIFOLDS\n\nWilliam D. Montoya\n\nInstituto de Matem´atica, Estat´ıstica e Computa¸c˜ao Cient´ıﬁca,\n\nIn [3] we proved that, under suitable conditions, on a very general codimension s quasi- smooth intersection subvariety X in a projective toric orbifold P d Σ with d + s = 2 ( k + 1 ) the Hodge conjecture holds, that is, every ( p, p ) -cohomology class, under the Poincar´e duality is a rational linear combination of fundamental classes of algebraic subvarieties of X . The proof of the above-mentioned result relies, for p ≠ d + 1 − s , on a Lefschetz\n\nKeywords: (1,1)- Lefschetz theorem, Hodge conjecture, toric varieties, complete intersection Email: wmontoya@ime.unicamp.br\n\ntheorem ([7]) and the Hard Lefschetz theorem for projective orbifolds ([11]). When p = d + 1 − s the proof relies on the Cayley trick, a trick which associates to X a quasi-smooth hypersurface Y in a projective vector bundle, and the Cayley Proposition (4.3) which gives an isomorphism of some primitive cohomologies (4.2) of X and Y . The Cayley trick, following the philosophy of Mavlyutov in [7], reduces results known for quasi-smooth hypersurfaces to quasi-smooth intersection subvarieties. The idea in this paper goes the other way around, we translate some results for quasi-smooth intersection subvarieties to\n\nAcknowledgement.

Moreover, T ∶ = N ⊗ Z C ∗ ≃ ( C ∗ ) d is the torus action on P d Σ . We denote by Σ ( i ) the i -dimensional cones\n\nFor a cone σ ∈ Σ, ˆ σ is the set of 1-dimensional cone in Σ that are not contained in σ\n\nand x ˆ σ ∶ = ∏ ρ ∈ ˆ σ x ρ is the associated monomial in S .\n\nDeﬁnition 2.2. The irrelevant ideal of P d Σ is the monomial ideal B Σ ∶ =< x ˆ σ ∣ σ ∈ Σ > and the zero locus Z ( Σ ) ∶ = V ( B Σ ) in the aﬃne space A d ∶ = Spec ( S ) is the irrelevant locus.\n\nProposition 2.3 (Theorem 5.1.11 [5]) . The toric variety P d Σ is a categorical quotient A d ∖ Z ( Σ ) by the group Hom ( Cl ( Σ ) , C ∗ ) and the group action is induced by the Cl ( Σ ) - grading of S .\n\nNow we give a brief introduction to complex orbifolds and we mention the needed theorems for the next section. Namely: de Rham theorem and Dolbeault theorem for complex orbifolds.\n\nDeﬁnition 2.4. A complex orbifold of complex dimension d is a singular complex space whose singularities are locally isomorphic to quotient singularities C d / G , for ﬁnite sub- groups G ⊂ Gl ( d, C ) .\n\nDeﬁnition 2.5. A diﬀerential form on a complex orbifold Z is deﬁned locally at z ∈ Z as a G -invariant diﬀerential form on C d where G ⊂ Gl ( d, C ) and Z is locally isomorphic to d\n\nRoughly speaking the local geometry of orbifolds reduces to local G -invariant geometry.\n\nWe have a complex of diﬀerential forms ( A ● ( Z ) , d ) and a double complex ( A ● , ● ( Z ) , ∂, ¯ ∂ ) of bigraded diﬀerential forms which deﬁne the de Rham and the Dolbeault cohomology groups (for a ﬁxed p ∈ N ) respectively:\n\n(1,1)-Lefschetz theorem for projective toric orbifolds\n\nDeﬁnition 3.1. A subvariety X ⊂ P d Σ is quasi-smooth if V ( I X ) ⊂ A #Σ ( 1 ) is smooth outside\n\nExample 3.2 . Quasi-smooth hypersurfaces or more generally quasi-smooth intersection sub-\n\nExample 3.2 . Quasi-smooth hypersurfaces or more generally quasi-smooth intersection sub- varieties are quasi-smooth subvarieties (see [2] or [7] for more details).\n\nRemark 3.3 . Quasi-smooth subvarieties are suborbifolds of P d Σ in the sense of Satake in [8]. Intuitively speaking they are subvarieties whose only singularities come from the ambient\n\nProof. From the exponential short exact sequence\n\nwe have a long exact sequence in cohomology\n\nH 1 (O ∗ X ) → H 2 ( X, Z ) → H 2 (O X ) ≃ H 0 , 2 ( X )\n\nwhere the last isomorphisms is due to Steenbrink in [9]. Now, it is enough to prove the commutativity of the next diagram\n\nwhere the last isomorphisms is due to Steenbrink in [9]. Now,\n\nH 2 ( X, Z ) / / H 2 ( X, O X ) ≃ Dolbeault H 2 ( X, C ) deRham ≃ H 2 dR ( X, C ) / / H 0 , 2 ¯ ∂ ( X )\n\nof the proof follows as the ( 1 , 1 ) -Lefschetz theorem in [6].\n\nRemark 3.5 . For k = 1 and P d Σ as the projective space, we recover the classical ( 1 , 1 ) - Lefschetz theorem.\n\nBy the Hard Lefschetz Theorem for projective orbifolds (see [11] for details) we\n\nBy the Hard Lefschetz Theorem for projective orbifolds (see [11] for details) we get an isomorphism of cohomologies :\n\ngiven by the Lefschetz morphism and since it is a morphism of Hodge structures, we have:\n\nH 1 , 1 ( X, Q ) ≃ H dim X − 1 , dim X − 1 ( X, Q )\n\nCorollary 3.6. If the dimension of X is 1 , 2 or 3 . The Hodge conjecture holds on X\n\nProof. If the dim C X = 1 the result is clear by the Hard Lefschetz theorem for projective orbifolds. The dimension 2 and 3 cases are covered by Theorem 3.5 and the Hard Lefschetz.\n\nCayley trick and Cayley proposition\n\nThe Cayley trick is a way to associate to a quasi-smooth intersection subvariety a quasi- smooth hypersurface. Let L 1 , . . . , L s be line bundles on P d Σ and let π ∶ P ( E ) → P d Σ be the projective space bundle associated to the vector bundle E = L 1 ⊕ ⋯ ⊕ L s . It is known that P ( E ) is a ( d + s − 1 ) -dimensional simplicial toric variety whose fan depends on the degrees of the line bundles and the fan Σ. Furthermore, if the Cox ring, without considering the grading, of P d Σ is C [ x 1 , . . . , x m ] then the Cox ring of P ( E ) is\n\nMoreover for X a quasi-smooth intersection subvariety cut oﬀ by f 1 , . . . , f s with deg ( f i ) = [ L i ] we relate the hypersurface Y cut oﬀ by F = y 1 f 1 + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + y s f s which turns out to be quasi-smooth. For more details see Section 2 in [7].\n\nWe will denote P ( E ) as P d + s − 1 Σ ,X to keep track of its relation with X and P d Σ .\n\nThe following is a key remark.\n\nRemark 4.1 . There is a morphism ι ∶ X → Y ⊂ P d + s − 1 Σ ,X . Moreover every point z ∶ = ( x, y ) ∈ Y with y ≠ 0 has a preimage. Hence for any subvariety W = V ( I W ) ⊂ X ⊂ P d Σ there exists W ′ ⊂ Y ⊂ P d + s − 1 Σ ,X such that π ( W ′ ) = W , i.e., W ′ = { z = ( x, y ) ∣ x ∈ W } .\n\nFor X ⊂ P d Σ a quasi-smooth intersection variety the morphism in cohomology induced by the inclusion i ∗ ∶ H d − s ( P d Σ , C ) → H d − s ( X, C ) is injective by Proposition 1.4 in [7].\n\nDeﬁnition 4.2. The primitive cohomology of H d − s prim ( X ) is the quotient H d − s ( X, C )/ i ∗ ( H d − s ( P d Σ , C )) and H d − s prim ( X, Q ) with rational coeﬃcients.\n\nH d − s ( P d Σ , C ) and H d − s ( X, C ) have pure Hodge structures, and the morphism i ∗ is com- patible with them, so that H d − s prim ( X ) gets a pure Hodge structure.\n\nThe next Proposition is the Cayley proposition.\n\nProposition 4.3. [Proposition 2.3 in [3] ] Let X = X 1 ∩⋅ ⋅ ⋅∩ X s be a quasi-smooth intersec- tion subvariety in P d Σ cut oﬀ by homogeneous polynomials f 1 . . . f s . Then for p ≠ d + s − 1 2 , d + s − 3 2\n\nRemark 4.5 . The above isomorphisms are also true with rational coeﬃcients since H ● ( X, C ) = H ● ( X, Q ) ⊗ Q C . See the beginning of Section 7.1 in [10] for more details.\n\nTheorem 5.1. Let Y = { F = y 1 f 1 + ⋯ + y k f k = 0 } ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X be the quasi-smooth hypersurface associated to the quasi-smooth intersection surface X = X f 1 ∩ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ∩ X f k ⊂ P k + 2 Σ . Then on Y the Hodge conjecture holds.\n\nthe Hodge conjecture holds.\n\nProof. If H k,k prim ( X, Q ) = 0 we are done. So let us assume H k,k prim ( X, Q ) ≠ 0. By the Cayley proposition H k,k prim ( Y, Q ) ≃ H 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) and by the ( 1 , 1 ) -Lefschetz theorem for projective\n\ntoric orbifolds there is a non-zero algebraic basis λ C 1 , . . . , λ C n with rational coeﬃcients of H 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) , that is, there are n ∶ = h 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) algebraic curves C 1 , . . . , C n in X such that under the Poincar´e duality the class in homology [ C i ] goes to λ C i , [ C i ] ↦ λ C i . Recall that the Cox ring of P k + 2 is contained in the Cox ring of P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X without considering the grading. Considering the grading we have that if α ∈ Cl ( P k + 2 Σ ) then ( α, 0 ) ∈ Cl ( P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X ) . So the polynomials deﬁning C i ⊂ P k + 2 Σ can be interpreted in P 2 k + 1 X, Σ but with diﬀerent degree. Moreover, by Remark 4.1 each C i is contained in Y = { F = y 1 f 1 + ⋯ + y k f k = 0 } and\n\nfurthermore it has codimension k .\n\nClaim: { C i } ni = 1 is a basis of prim ( ) . It is enough to prove that λ C i is diﬀerent from zero in H k,k prim ( Y, Q ) or equivalently that the cohomology classes { λ C i } ni = 1 do not come from the ambient space. By contradiction, let us assume that there exists a j and C ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X such that λ C ∈ H k,k ( P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X , Q ) with i ∗ ( λ C ) = λ C j or in terms of homology there exists a ( k + 2 ) -dimensional algebraic subvariety V ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X such that V ∩ Y = C j so they are equal as a homology class of P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X ,i.e., [ V ∩ Y ] = [ C j ] . It is easy to check that π ( V ) ∩ X = C j as a subvariety of P k + 2 Σ where π ∶ ( x, y ) ↦ x . Hence [ π ( V ) ∩ X ] = [ C j ] which is equivalent to say that λ C j comes from P k + 2 Σ which contradicts the choice of [ C j ] .\n\nRemark 5.2 . Into the proof of the previous theorem, the key fact was that on X the Hodge conjecture holds and we translate it to Y by contradiction. So, using an analogous argument we have:\n\nargument we have:\n\nProposition 5.3. Let Y = { F = y 1 f s +⋯+ y s f s = 0 } ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X be the quasi-smooth hypersurface associated to a quasi-smooth intersection subvariety X = X f 1 ∩ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ∩ X f s ⊂ P d Σ such that d + s = 2 ( k + 1 ) . If the Hodge conjecture holds on X then it holds as well on Y .\n\nCorollary 5.4. If the dimension of Y is 2 s − 1 , 2 s or 2 s + 1 then the Hodge conjecture holds on Y .\n\nProof.

Document(page_content='Recently, various DL models and datasets have been developed for layout analysis\ntasks. The dhSegment [22] utilizes fully convolutional networks [20] for segmen-\ntation tasks on historical documents. Object detection-based methods like Faster\nR-CNN [28] and Mask R-CNN [12] are used for identifying document elements [38]\nand detecting tables [30, 26]. Most recently, Graph Neural Networks [29] have also\nbeen used in table detection [27]. However, these models are usually implemented\nindividually and there is no uniﬁed framework to load and use such models.\nThere has been a surge of interest in creating open-source tools for document\nimage processing: a search of document image analysis in Github leads to 5M\nrelevant code pieces 6; yet most of them rely on traditional rule-based methods\nor provide limited functionalities. The closest prior research to our work is the\nOCR-D project7, which also tries to build a complete toolkit for DIA. However,\nsimilar to the platform developed by Neudecker et al. [21], it is designed for\nanalyzing historical documents, and provides no supports for recent DL models.\nThe DocumentLayoutAnalysis project8 focuses on processing born-digital PDF\ndocuments via analyzing the stored PDF data. Repositories like DeepLayout9\nand Detectron2-PubLayNet10 are individual deep learning models trained on\nlayout analysis datasets without support for the full DIA pipeline. The Document\nAnalysis and Exploitation (DAE) platform [15] and the DeepDIVA project [2]\naim to improve the reproducibility of DIA methods (or DL models), yet they\nare not actively maintained. OCR engines like Tesseract [14], easyOCR11 and\npaddleOCR12 usually do not come with comprehensive functionalities for other\nDIA tasks like layout analysis.\nRecent years have also seen numerous eﬀorts to create libraries for promoting\nreproducibility and reusability in the ﬁeld of DL.

For an input document image,\nthe core LayoutParser library provides a set of oﬀ-the-shelf tools for layout\ndetection, OCR, visualization, and storage, backed by a carefully designed layout\ndata structure. LayoutParser also supports high level customization via eﬃcient\nlayout annotation and model training functions. These improve model accuracy\non the target samples. The community platform enables the easy sharing of DIA\nmodels and whole digitization pipelines to promote reusability and reproducibility.\nA collection of detailed documentation, tutorials and exemplar projects make\nLayoutParser easy to learn and use.\nAllenNLP [8] and transformers [34] have provided the community with complete\nDL-based support for developing and deploying models for general computer\nvision and natural language processing problems. LayoutParser, on the other\nhand, specializes speciﬁcally in DIA tasks. LayoutParser is also equipped with a\ncommunity platform inspired by established model hubs such as Torch Hub [23]\nand TensorFlow Hub [1]. It enables the sharing of pretrained models as well as\nfull document processing pipelines that are unique to DIA tasks.\nThere have been a variety of document data collections to facilitate the\ndevelopment of DL models. Some examples include PRImA [3](magazine layouts),\nPubLayNet [38](academic paper layouts), Table Bank [18](tables in academic\npapers), Newspaper Navigator Dataset [16, 17](newspaper ﬁgure layouts) and\nHJDataset [31](historical Japanese document layouts).

It was developed with the aim of providing an open, XML-based file format specification for office applications.


The standard is developed and maintained by a technical committee in the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) consortium. It was based on the Sun Microsystems specification for OpenOffice.org XML, the default format for OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice. It was originally developed for StarOffice “to provide an open standard for office documents.”

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/document_loaders/examples/json.html,"JSON#

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and arrays (or other serializable values).


The JSONLoader uses a specified jq schema to parse the JSON files. It uses the jq python package.
Check this manual for a detailed documentation of the jq syntax.

Using JSONLoader#
Suppose we are interested in extracting the values under the content field within the messages key of the JSON data. This can easily be done through the JSONLoader as shown below.


loader = JSONLoader(
file_path='./example_data/facebook_chat.json',
jq_schema='.messages[].content')

data = loader.load()













pprint(data)











[Document(page_content='Bye!', metadata={'source': '/Users/avsolatorio/WBG/langchain/docs/modules/indexes/document_loaders/examples/example_data/facebook_chat.json', 'seq_num': 1}),

Extracting metadata#
Generally, we want to include metadata available in the JSON file into the documents that we create from the content.
The following demonstrates how metadata can be extracted using the JSONLoader.
There are some key changes to be noted. In the previous example where we didn’t collect the metadata, we managed to directly specify in the schema where the value for the page_content can be extracted from.
.messages[].content









In the current example, we have to tell the loader to iterate over the records in the messages field. The jq_schema then has to be:
.messages[]









This allows us to pass the records (dict) into the metadata_func that has to be implemented. The metadata_func is responsible for identifying which pieces of information in the record should be included in the metadata stored in the final Document object.
Additionally, we now have to explicitly specify in the loader, via the content_key argument, the key from the record where the value for the page_content needs to be extracted from.


# Define the metadata extraction function.
def metadata_func(record: dict, metadata: dict) -> dict:

metadata[""sender_name""] = record.get(""sender_name"")
metadata[""timestamp_ms""] = record.get(""timestamp_ms"")

return metadata


loader = JSONLoader(
file_path='./example_data/facebook_chat.json',
jq_schema='.messages[]',
content_key=""content"",
metadata_func=metadata_func
)

data = loader.load()













pprint(data)











[Document(page_content='Bye!', metadata={'source': '/Users/avsolatorio/WBG/langchain/docs/modules/indexes/document_loaders/examples/example_data/facebook_chat.json', 'seq_num': 1, 'sender_name': 'User 2', 'timestamp_ms': 1675597571851}),

Now, you will see that the documents contain the metadata associated with the content we extracted.


The metadata_func#
As shown above, the metadata_func accepts the default metadata generated by the JSONLoader. This allows full control to the user with respect to how the metadata is formatted.
For example, the default metadata contains the source and the seq_num keys. However, it is possible that the JSON data contain these keys as well. The user can then exploit the metadata_func to rename the default keys and use the ones from the JSON data.
The example below shows how we can modify the source to only contain information of the file source relative to the langchain directory.


# Define the metadata extraction function.
def metadata_func(record: dict, metadata: dict) -> dict:

metadata[""sender_name""] = record.get(""sender_name"")
metadata[""timestamp_ms""] = record.get(""timestamp_ms"")

if ""source"" in metadata:
source = metadata[""source""].split(""/"")
source = source[source.index(""langchain""):]
metadata[""source""] = ""/"".join(source)

return metadata


loader = JSONLoader(
file_path='./example_data/facebook_chat.json',
jq_schema='.messages[]',
content_key=""content"",
metadata_func=metadata_func
)

data = loader.load()

Auto detect file encodings with TextLoader#
In this example we will see some strategies that can be useful when loading a big list of arbitrary files from a directory using the TextLoader class.
First to illustrate the problem, let’s try to load multiple text with arbitrary encodings.


path = '../../../../../tests/integration_tests/examples'
loader = DirectoryLoader(path, glob=""**/*.txt"", loader_cls=TextLoader)












A. Default Behavior#


loader.load()

RuntimeError: Error loading ../../../../../tests/integration_tests/examples/example-non-utf8.txt



The file example-non-utf8.txt uses a different encoding the load() function fails with a helpful message indicating which file failed decoding.
With the default behavior of TextLoader any failure to load any of the documents will fail the whole loading process and no documents are loaded.


B. Silent fail#
We can pass the parameter silent_errors to the DirectoryLoader to skip the files which could not be loaded and continue the load process.


loader = DirectoryLoader(path, glob=""**/*.txt"", loader_cls=TextLoader, silent_errors=True)
docs = loader.load()

doc_sources











['../../../../../tests/integration_tests/examples/whatsapp_chat.txt',
 '../../../../../tests/integration_tests/examples/example-utf8.txt']













C. Auto detect encodings#
We can also ask TextLoader to auto detect the file encoding before failing, by passing the autodetect_encoding to the loader class.


text_loader_kwargs={'autodetect_encoding': True}
loader = DirectoryLoader(path, glob=""**/*.txt"", loader_cls=TextLoader, loader_kwargs=text_loader_kwargs)
docs = loader.load()













doc_sources = [doc.metadata['source']for doc in docs]

[Document(page_content=""Hello, my name is Andrej and I've been training deep neural networks for a bit more than a decade. And in this lecture I'd like to show you what neural network training looks like under the hood. So in particular we are going to start with a blank Jupyter notebook and by the end of this lecture we will define and train a neural net and you'll get to see everything that goes on under the hood and exactly sort of how that works on an intuitive level. Now specifically what I would like to do is I would like to take you through building of micrograd. Now micrograd is this library that I released on GitHub about two years ago but at the time I only uploaded the source code and you'd have to go in by yourself and really figure out how it works. So in this lecture I will take you through it step by step and kind of comment on all the pieces of it. So what is micrograd and why is it interesting? Thank you. Micrograd is basically an autograd engine. Autograd is short for automatic gradient and really what it does is it implements back propagation. Now back propagation is this algorithm that allows you to efficiently evaluate the gradient of some kind of a loss function with respect to the weights of a neural network and what that allows us to do then is we can iteratively tune the weights of that neural network to minimize the loss function and therefore improve the accuracy of the network. So back propagation would be at the mathematical core of any modern deep neural network library like say PyTorch or JAX. So the functionality of micrograd is I think best illustrated by an example. So if we just scroll down here you'll see that micrograd basically allows you to build out mathematical expressions and here what we are doing is we have an expression that we're building out where you have two inputs a and b and you'll see that a and b are negative four and two but we are wrapping those values into this value object that we are going to build out as part of micrograd. So this value object will wrap the numbers themselves and then we are going to build out a mathematical expression here where a and b are transformed into c d and eventually e f and g and I'm showing some of the functionality of micrograd and the operations that it supports. So you can add two value objects, you can multiply them, you can raise them to a constant power, you can offset by one, negate, squash at zero, square, divide by constant, divide by it, etc. And so we're building out an expression graph with these two inputs a and b and we're creating an output value of g and micrograd will in the background build out this entire mathematical expression. So it will for example know that c is also a value, c was a result of an addition operation and the child nodes of c are a and b because the and it will maintain pointers to a and b value objects. So we'll basically know exactly how all of this is laid out and then not only can we do what we call the forward pass where we actually look at the value of g of course, that's pretty straightforward, we will access that using the dot data attribute and so the output of the forward pass, the value of g, is 24.7 it turns out. But the big deal is that we can also take this g value object and we can call dot backward and this will basically initialize backpropagation at the node g. And what backpropagation is going to do is it's going to start at g and it's going to go backwards through that expression graph and it's going to recursively apply the chain rule from calculus. And what that allows us to do then is we're going to evaluate basically the derivative of g with respect to all the internal nodes like e, d, and c but also with respect to the inputs a and b. And then we can actually query this derivative of g with respect to a, for example that's a.grad, in this case it happens to be 138, and the derivative of g with respect to b which also happens to be here 645. And this derivative we'll see soon is very important information because it's telling us how a and b are affecting g through this mathematical expression. So in particular a.grad is 138, so if we slightly nudge a and make it slightly larger, 138 is telling us that g will grow and the slope of that growth is going to be 138 and the slope of growth of b is going to be 645. So that's going to tell us about how g will respond if a and b get tweaked a tiny amount in a positive direction. Now you might be confused about what this expression is that we built out here and this expression by the way is completely meaningless. I just made it up, I'm just flexing about the kinds of operations that are supported by micrograd. What we actually really care about are neural networks but it turns out that neural networks are just mathematical expressions just like this one but actually slightly a bit less crazy even. Neural networks are just a mathematical expression, they take the input data as an input and they take the weights of a neural network as an input and it's a mathematical expression and the output are your predictions of your neural net or the loss function, we'll see this in a bit. But basically neural networks just happen to be a certain class of mathematical expressions but back propagation is actually significantly more general. It doesn't actually care about neural networks at all, it only cares about arbitrary mathematical expressions and then we happen to use that machinery for training of neural networks. Now one more note I would like to make at this stage is that as you see here micrograd is a scalar valued autograd engine so it's working on the you know level of individual scalars like negative 4 and 2 and we're taking neural nets and we're breaking them down all the way to these atoms of individual scalars and all the little pluses and times and it's just excessive and so obviously you would never be doing any of this in production. It's really just done for pedagogical reasons because it allows us to not have to deal with these n-dimensional tensors that you would use in modern deep neural network library. So this is really done so that you understand and refactor out back propagation and chain rule and understanding of neural training and then if you actually want to train bigger networks you have to be using these tensors but none of the math changes, this is done purely for efficiency. We are basically taking all the scalars all the scalar values we're packaging them up into tensors which are just arrays of these scalars and then because we have these large arrays we're making operations on those large arrays that allows us to take advantage of the parallelism in a computer and all those operations can be done in parallel and then the whole thing runs faster but really none of the math changes and they're done purely for efficiency so I don't think that it's pedagogically useful to be dealing with tensors from scratch and I think and that's why I fundamentally wrote micrograd because you can understand how things work at the fundamental level and then you can speed it up later. Okay so here's the fun part. My claim is that micrograd is what you need to train neural networks and everything else is just efficiency so you'd think that micrograd would be a very complex piece of code and that turns out to not be the case. So if we just go to micrograd and you'll see that there's only two files here in micrograd. This is the actual engine, it doesn't know anything about neural nets and this is the entire neural nets library on top of micrograd. So engine and nn.py. So the actual back propagation autograd engine that gives you the power of neural networks is literally 100 lines of code of like very simple python which we'll understand by the end of this lecture and then nn.py, this neural network library built on top of the autograd engine is like a joke. It's like we have to define what is a neuron and then we have to define what is a layer of neurons and then we define what is a multilayer perceptron which is just a sequence of layers of neurons and so it's just a total joke. So basically there's a lot of power that comes from only 150 lines of code and that's all you need to understand to understand neural network training and everything else is just efficiency and of course there's a lot to efficiency but fundamentally that's all that's happening. Okay so now let's dive right in and implement micrograd step by step. The first thing I'd like to do is I'd like to make sure that you have a very good understanding intuitively of what a derivative is and exactly what information it gives you. So let's start with some basic imports that I copy-paste in every jupyter notebook always and let's define a function, a scalar valued function f of x as follows. So I just made this up randomly. I just wanted a scalar valued function that takes a single scalar x and returns a single scalar y and we can call this function of course so we can pass in say 3.0 and get 20 back. Now we can also plot this function to get a sense of its shape. You can tell from the mathematical expression that this is probably a parabola, it's a quadratic and so if we just create a set of scalar values that we can feed in using for example a range from negative 5 to 5 in steps of 0.25. So this is so x is just from negative 5 to 5 not including 5 in steps of 0.25 and we can actually call this function on this numpy array as well so we get a set of y's if we call f on x's and these y's are basically also applying the function on every one of these elements independently and we can plot this using matplotlib. So plt.plot x's and y's and we get a nice parabola. So previously here we fed in 3.0 somewhere here and we received 20 back which is here the y-coordinate. So now I'd like to think through what is the derivative of this function at any single input point x. So what is the derivative at different points x of this function? Now if you remember back to your calculus class you've probably derived derivatives so we take this mathematical expression 3x squared minus 4x plus 5 and you would write out on a piece of paper and you would apply the product rule and all the other rules and derive the mathematical expression of the great derivative of the original function and then you could plug in different texts and see what the derivative is. We're not going to actually do that because no one in neural networks actually writes out the expression for the neural net. It would be a massive expression, it would be thousands, tens of thousands of terms. No one actually derives the derivative of course and so we're not going to take this kind of like symbolic approach. Instead what I'd like to do is I'd like to look at the definition of derivative and just make sure that we really understand what the derivative is measuring, what it's telling you about the function. And so if we just look up derivative we see that okay so this is not a very good definition of derivative. This is a definition of what it means to be differentiable but if you remember from your calculus it is the limit as h goes to zero of f of x plus h minus f of x over h. So basically what it's saying is if you slightly bump up your at some point x that you're interested in or a and if you slightly bump up you know you slightly increase it by small number h how does the function respond with what sensitivity does it respond where is the slope at that point does the function go up or does it go down and by how much and that's the slope of that function the the slope of that response at that point and so we can basically evaluate the derivative here numerically by taking a very small h of course the definition would ask us to take h to zero we're just going to pick a very small h 0.001 and let's say we're interested in 0.3.0 so we can look at f of x of course as 20 and now f of x plus h so if we slightly nudge x in a positive direction how is the function going to respond and just looking at this do you expand do you expect f of x plus h to be slightly greater than 20 or do you expect it to be slightly lower than 20 and since this 3 is here and this is 20 if we slightly go positively the function will respond positively so you'd expect this to be slightly greater than 20 and now by how much is telling you the sort of the the strength of that slope right the the size of the slope so f of x plus h minus f of x this is how much the function responded in a positive direction and we have to normalize by the run so we have the rise over run to get the slope so this of course is just a numerical approximation of the slope because we have to make h very very small to converge to the exact amount now if i'm doing too many zeros at some point i'm going to i'm going to get an incorrect answer because we're using floating point arithmetic and the representations of all these numbers in computer memory is finite and at some point we get into trouble so we can converge towards the right answer with this approach but basically at 3 the slope is 14 and you can see that by taking 3x squared minus 4x plus 5 and differentiating it in our head so 3x squared would be 6x minus 4 and then we plug in x equals 3 so that's 18 minus 4 is 14 so this is correct so that's at 3 now how about the slope at say negative 3 would you expect what would you expect for the slope now telling the exact value is really hard but what is the sign of that slope so at negative 3 if we slightly go in the positive direction at x the function would actually go down and so that tells you that the slope would be negative so we'll get a slight number below below 20 and so if we take the slope we expect something negative negative 22 okay and at some point here of course the slope would be zero now for this specific function i looked it up previously and it's at point uh 2 over 3 so at roughly 2 over 3 that's somewhere here this this derivative would be zero so basically at that precise point yeah at that precise point if we nudge in a positive direction the function doesn't respond this stays the same almost and so that's why the slope is zero okay now let's look at a bit more complex case so we're going to start you know complexifying a bit so now we have a function here with output variable d that is a function of three scalar inputs a b and c so a b and c are some specific values three inputs into our expression graph and a single output d and so if we just print d we get four and now what i like to do is i'd like to again look at the derivatives of d with respect to a b and c and uh think through uh again just the intuition of what this derivative is telling us so in order to evaluate this derivative we're going to get a bit hacky here we're going to again have a very small value of h and then we're going to fix the inputs at some values that we're interested in so these are the this is the point a b c at which we're going to be evaluating the the derivative of d with respect to all a b and c at that point so there are the inputs and now we have d1 is that expression and then we're going to for example look at the derivative of d with respect to a so we'll take a and we'll bump it by h and then we'll get d2 to be the exact same function and now we're going to print um you know f1 d1 is d1 d2 is d2 and print slope so the derivative or slope here will be um of course d2 minus d1 divide h so d2 minus d1 is how much the function increased uh when we bumped the uh the specific input that we're interested in by a tiny amount and this is the normalized by this is the normalized by h to get the slope so um yeah so this so i just run this we're going to print d1 which we know is four now d2 will be bumped a will be bumped by h so let's just think through a little bit uh what d2 will be uh printed out here in particular d1 will be four will d2 be a number slightly greater than four or slightly lower than four and that's going to tell us the sign of the derivative so we're bumping a by h b is minus three c is 10 so you can just intuitively think through this derivative and what it's doing a will be slightly more positive and but b is a negative number so if a is slightly more positive because b is negative three we're actually going to be adding less to d so you'd actually expect that the value of the function will go down so let's just see this yeah and so we went from four to 3.9996 and that tells you that the slope will be negative and then um will be a negative number because we went down and then the exact number of slope will be exact amount of slope is negative three and you can also convince yourself that negative three is the right answer um mathematically and analytically because if you have a times b plus c and you are you know you have calculus then uh differentiating a times b plus c with respect to a gives you just b and indeed the value of b is negative three which is the derivative that we have so you can tell that that's correct so now if we do this with b so if we bump b by a little bit in a positive direction we'd get different slopes so what is the influence of b on the output d so if we bump b by a tiny amount in a positive direction then because a is positive we'll be adding more to d right so um and now what is the what is the sensitivity what is the slope of that addition and it might not surprise you that this should be two and why is it two because d of d by db differentiating with respect to b would be would give us a and the value of a is two so that's also working well and then if c gets bumped a tiny amount in h by h then of course a times b is unaffected and now c becomes slightly bit higher what does that do to the function it makes it slightly bit higher because we're simply adding c and it makes it slightly bit higher by the exact same amount that we added to c and so that tells you that the slope is one that will be the the rate at which d will increase as we scale c okay so we now have some intuitive sense of what this derivative is telling you about the function and we'd like to move to neural networks now as i mentioned neural networks will be pretty massive expressions mathematical expressions so we need some data structures that maintain these expressions and that's what we're going to start to build out now so we're going to build out this value object that i showed you in the readme page of micrograd so let me copy paste a skeleton of the first very simple value object so class value takes a single scalar value that it wraps and keeps track of and that's it so we can for example do value of 2.0 and then we can get we can look at its content and python will internally use the wrapper function to return this string like that so this is a value object that we're going to call value object"", metadata={'source': 'example_data/Lecture_1_0.mp3'})]

Combining language models with your own text data is a powerful way to differentiate them.
The first step in doing this is to load the data into “Documents” - a fancy way of say some pieces of text.
The document loader is aimed at making this easy.
The following document loaders are provided:

Transform loaders#
These transform loaders transform data from a specific format into the Document format.
For example, there are transformers for CSV and SQL.
Mostly, these loaders input data from files but sometime from URLs.
A primary driver of a lot of these transformers is the Unstructured python package.
This package transforms many types of files - text, powerpoint, images, html, pdf, etc - into text data.

LangChain primarily focuses on constructing indexes with the goal of using them as a Retriever. In order to best understand what this means, it’s worth highlighting what the base Retriever interface is. The BaseRetriever class in LangChain is as follows:


from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import List
from langchain.schema import Document

class BaseRetriever(ABC):
@abstractmethod
def get_relevant_documents(self, query: str) -> List[Document]:
""""""Get texts relevant for a query.

Args:
query: string to find relevant texts for

Returns:
List of relevant documents
""""""











It’s that simple! The get_relevant_documents method can be implemented however you see fit.
Of course, we also help construct what we think useful Retrievers are. The main type of Retriever that we focus on is a Vectorstore retriever. We will focus on that for the rest of this guide.
In order to understand what a vectorstore retriever is, it’s important to understand what a Vectorstore is. So let’s look at that.
By default, LangChain uses Chroma as the vectorstore to index and search embeddings. To walk through this tutorial, we’ll first need to install chromadb.
pip install chromadb









This example showcases question answering over documents.
We have chosen this as the example for getting started because it nicely combines a lot of different elements (Text splitters, embeddings, vectorstores) and then also shows how to use them in a chain.
Question answering over documents consists of four steps:

Create an index
Create a Retriever from that index
Create a question answering chain
Ask questions!

Each of the steps has multiple sub steps and potential configurations. In this notebook we will primarily focus on (1). We will start by showing the one-liner for doing so, but then break down what is actually going on.
First, let’s import some common classes we’ll use no matter what.


from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.llms import OpenAI











Next in the generic setup, let’s specify the document loader we want to use. You can download the state_of_the_union.txt file here


from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
loader = TextLoader('../state_of_the_union.txt', encoding='utf8')












One Line Index Creation#
To get started as quickly as possible, we can use the VectorstoreIndexCreator.


from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator













index = VectorstoreIndexCreator().from_loaders([loader])











Running Chroma using direct local API.
Using DuckDB in-memory for database. Data will be transient.











Now that the index is created, we can use it to ask questions of the data! Note that under the hood this is actually doing a few steps as well, which we will cover later in this guide.


query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
index.query(query)











"" The president said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds, a former top litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender, and from a family of public school educators and police officers. He also said that she is a consensus builder and has received a broad range of support from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.""













query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
index.query_with_sources(query)











{'question': 'What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson',
 'answer': "" The president said that he nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, one of the nation's top legal minds, to continue Justice Breyer's legacy of excellence, and that she has received a broad range of support from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.\n"",
 'sources': '../state_of_the_union.txt'}











What is returned from the VectorstoreIndexCreator is VectorStoreIndexWrapper, which provides these nice query and query_with_sources functionality. If we just wanted to access the vectorstore directly, we can also do that.


index.vectorstore











<langchain.vectorstores.chroma.Chroma at 0x119aa5940>











If we then want to access the VectorstoreRetriever, we can do that with:


index.vectorstore.as_retriever()











VectorStoreRetriever(vectorstore=<langchain.vectorstores.chroma.Chroma object at 0x119aa5940>, search_kwargs={})













Walkthrough#
Okay, so what’s actually going on? How is this index getting created?
A lot of the magic is being hid in this VectorstoreIndexCreator. What is this doing?
There are three main steps going on after the documents are loaded:

Splitting documents into chunks
Creating embeddings for each document
Storing documents and embeddings in a vectorstore

Let’s walk through this in code


documents = loader.load()











Next, we will split the documents into chunks.


from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)











We will then select which embeddings we want to use.


from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()











We now create the vectorstore to use as the index.


from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
db = Chroma.from_documents(texts, embeddings)











Running Chroma using direct local API.
Using DuckDB in-memory for database. Data will be transient.











So that’s creating the index. Then, we expose this index in a retriever interface.


retriever = db.as_retriever()











Then, as before, we create a chain and use it to answer questions!


qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=OpenAI(), chain_type=""stuff"", retriever=retriever)













query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
qa.run(query)











"" The President said that Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds, a former top litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender, and from a family of public school educators and police officers. He said she is a consensus builder and has received a broad range of support from organizations such as the Fraternal Order of Police and former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.""











VectorstoreIndexCreator is just a wrapper around all this logic. It is configurable in the text splitter it uses, the embeddings it uses, and the vectorstore it uses. For example, you can configure it as below:


index_creator = VectorstoreIndexCreator(
vectorstore_cls=Chroma, 
embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings(),
text_splitter=CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
)











Hopefully this highlights what is going on under the hood of VectorstoreIndexCreator. While we think it’s important to have a simple way to create indexes, we also think it’s important to understand what’s going on under the hood."

Note
Conceptual Guide

Indexes refer to ways to structure documents so that LLMs can best interact with them.
The most common way that indexes are used in chains is in a “retrieval” step.
This step refers to taking a user’s query and returning the most relevant documents.
We draw this distinction because (1) an index can be used for other things besides retrieval, and
(2) retrieval can use other logic besides an index to find relevant documents.
We therefore have a concept of a Retriever interface - this is the interface that most chains work with.
Most of the time when we talk about indexes and retrieval we are talking about indexing and retrieving
unstructured data (like text documents).
For interacting with structured data (SQL tables, etc) or APIs, please see the corresponding use case
sections for links to relevant functionality.

REACT Agent Chat Message History Example#
This notebook demonstrates how to use the Zep Long-term Memory Store as memory for your chatbot.
We’ll demonstrate:

Adding conversation history to the Zep memory store.
Running an agent and having message automatically added to the store.
Viewing the enriched messages.
Vector search over the conversation history.

More on Zep:
Zep stores, summarizes, embeds, indexes, and enriches conversational AI chat histories, and exposes them via simple, low-latency APIs.
Key Features:

Long-term memory persistence, with access to historical messages irrespective of your summarization strategy.
Auto-summarization of memory messages based on a configurable message window. A series of summaries are stored, providing flexibility for future summarization strategies.
Vector search over memories, with messages automatically embedded on creation.
Auto-token counting of memories and summaries, allowing finer-grained control over prompt assembly.
Python and JavaScript SDKs.

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/memory/examples/custom_memory.html,"How to create a custom Memory class#
Although there are a few predefined types of memory in LangChain, it is highly possible you will want to add your own type of memory that is optimal for your application. This notebook covers how to do that.
For this notebook, we will add a custom memory type to ConversationChain. In order to add a custom memory class, we need to import the base memory class and subclass it.


from langchain import OpenAI, ConversationChain
from langchain.schema import BaseMemory
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Dict, Any











In this example, we will write a custom memory class that uses spacy to extract entities and save information about them in a simple hash table. Then, during the conversation, we will look at the input text, extract any entities, and put any information about them into the context.

Please note that this implementation is pretty simple and brittle and probably not useful in a production setting. Its purpose is to showcase that you can add custom memory implementations.

For this, we will need spacy.


# !pip install spacy
# !python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg













import spacy
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_lg')













class SpacyEntityMemory(BaseMemory, BaseModel):
""""""Memory class for storing information about entities.""""""

# Define dictionary to store information about entities.
entities: dict = {}
# Define key to pass information about entities into prompt.
memory_key: str = ""entities""

def clear(self):
self.entities = {}

@property
def memory_variables(self) -> List[str]:
""""""Define the variables we are providing to the prompt.""""""
return [self.memory_key]

def load_memory_variables(self, inputs: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, str]:
""""""Load the memory variables, in this case the entity key.""""""
# Get the input text and run through spacy
doc = nlp(inputs[list(inputs.keys())[0]])
# Extract known information about entities, if they exist.
entities = [self.entities[str(ent)] for ent in doc.ents if str(ent) in self.entities]
# Return combined information about entities to put into context.
return {self.memory_key: ""\n"".join(entities)}

def save_context(self, inputs: Dict[str, Any], outputs: Dict[str, str]) -> None:
""""""Save context from this conversation to buffer.""""""
# Get the input text and run through spacy
text = inputs[list(inputs.keys())[0]]
doc = nlp(text)
# For each entity that was mentioned, save this information to the dictionary.
for ent in doc.ents:
ent_str = str(ent)
if ent_str in self.entities:
self.entities[ent_str] += f""\n{text}""
else:
self.entities[ent_str] = text











We now define a prompt that takes in information about entities as well as user input


from langchain.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate

template = """"""The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context.

In order to add a memory with an external message store to an agent we are going to do the following steps:

We are going to create an LLMChain using that chat history as memory.

Notice the usage of the chat_history variable in the PromptTemplate, which matches up with the dynamic key name in the ConversationBufferMemory.

This notebook goes over adding memory to an Agent. Before going through this notebook, please walkthrough the following notebooks, as this will build on top of both of them:

Adding memory to an LLM Chain
Custom Agents

In order to add a memory to an agent we are going to the the following steps:

We are going to create an LLMChain with memory.
We are going to use that LLMChain to create a custom Agent.

For the purposes of this exercise, we are going to create a simple custom Agent that has access to a search tool and utilizes the ConversationBufferMemory class.


from langchain.agents import ZeroShotAgent, Tool, AgentExecutor
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain import OpenAI, LLMChain
from langchain.utilities import GoogleSearchAPIWrapper













search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper()
tools = [
Tool(
name = ""Search"",
func=search.run,
description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events""
)
]











Notice the usage of the chat_history variable in the PromptTemplate, which matches up with the dynamic key name in the ConversationBufferMemory.


prefix = """"""Have a conversation with a human, answering the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:""""""
suffix = """"""Begin!""

{chat_history}
Question: {input}
{agent_scratchpad}""""""

prompt = ZeroShotAgent.create_prompt(
tools, 
prefix=prefix, 
suffix=suffix, 
input_variables=[""input"", ""chat_history"", ""agent_scratchpad""]
)
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"")











We can now construct the LLMChain, with the Memory object, and then create the agent.


llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), prompt=prompt)
agent = ZeroShotAgent(llm_chain=llm_chain, tools=tools, verbose=True)
agent_chain = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True, memory=memory)

'The current population of Canada is 38,566,192 as of Saturday, December 31, 2022, based on Worldometer elaboration of the latest United Nations data.'











To test the memory of this agent, we can ask a followup question that relies on information in the previous exchange to be answered correctly.

We can see that the agent remembered that the previous question was about Canada, and properly asked Google Search what the name of Canada’s national anthem was.

VectorStoreRetrieverMemory stores memories in a VectorDB and queries the top-K most “salient” docs every time it is called.
This differs from most of the other Memory classes in that it doesn’t explicitly track the order of interactions.
In this case, the “docs” are previous conversation snippets. This can be useful to refer to relevant pieces of information that the AI was told earlier in the conversation.

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/memory/types/summary.html,"ConversationSummaryMemory#
Now let’s take a look at using a slightly more complex type of memory - ConversationSummaryMemory. This type of memory creates a summary of the conversation over time. This can be useful for condensing information from the conversation over time.
Let’s first explore the basic functionality of this type of memory.


from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory, ChatMessageHistory
from langchain.llms import OpenAI













memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0))
memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""})













memory.load_memory_variables({})











{'history': '\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds.'}











We can also get the history as a list of messages (this is useful if you are using this with a chat model).


memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), return_messages=True)
memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""})













memory.load_memory_variables({})











{'history': [SystemMessage(content='\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds.', additional_kwargs={})]}











We can also utilize the predict_new_summary method directly.


messages = memory.chat_memory.messages
previous_summary = """"
memory.predict_new_summary(messages, previous_summary)











'\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds.'












Initializing with messages#
If you have messages outside this class, you can easily initialize the class with ChatMessageHistory. During loading, a summary will be calculated.


history = ChatMessageHistory()
history.add_user_message(""hi"")
history.add_ai_message(""hi there!"")













memory = ConversationSummaryMemory.from_messages(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), chat_memory=history, return_messages=True)













memory.buffer











'\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds with a friendly greeting.'













Using in a chain#
Let’s walk through an example of using this in a chain, again setting verbose=True so we can see the prompt.


from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
conversation_with_summary = ConversationChain(

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
memory = ConversationKGMemory(llm=llm)
memory.save_context({""input"": ""say hi to sam""}, {""output"": ""who is sam""})
memory.save_context({""input"": ""sam is a friend""}, {""output"": ""okay""})













memory.load_memory_variables({""input"": 'who is sam'})











{'history': 'On Sam: Sam is friend.'}











We can also get the history as a list of messages (this is useful if you are using this with a chat model).


memory = ConversationKGMemory(llm=llm, return_messages=True)
memory.save_context({""input"": ""say hi to sam""}, {""output"": ""who is sam""})

memory.load_memory_variables({""input"": 'who is sam'})











{'history': [SystemMessage(content='On Sam: Sam is friend.', additional_kwargs={})]}











We can also more modularly get current entities from a new message (will use previous messages as context.)


memory.get_current_entities(""what's Sams favorite color?"")











['Sam']











We can also more modularly get knowledge triplets from a new message (will use previous messages as context.)

Let’s first explore the basic functionality of this type of memory.


from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory













memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory( k=1)
memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""})
memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""})













memory.load_memory_variables({})











{'history': 'Human: not much you\nAI: not much'}











We can also get the history as a list of messages (this is useful if you are using this with a chat model).


memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory( k=1, return_messages=True)
memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""})
memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""})













memory.load_memory_variables({})











{'history': [HumanMessage(content='not much you', additional_kwargs={}),
AIMessage(content='not much', additional_kwargs={})]}












Using in a chain#

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/memory/getting_started.html,"Getting Started#
This notebook walks through how LangChain thinks about memory.
Memory involves keeping a concept of state around throughout a user’s interactions with an language model. A user’s interactions with a language model are captured in the concept of ChatMessages, so this boils down to ingesting, capturing, transforming and extracting knowledge from a sequence of chat messages. There are many different ways to do this, each of which exists as its own memory type.
In general, for each type of memory there are two ways to understanding using memory. These are the standalone functions which extract information from a sequence of messages, and then there is the way you can use this type of memory in a chain.
Memory can return multiple pieces of information (for example, the most recent N messages and a summary of all previous messages). The returned information can either be a string or a list of messages.
In this notebook, we will walk through the simplest form of memory: “buffer” memory, which just involves keeping a buffer of all prior messages. We will show how to use the modular utility functions here, then show how it can be used in a chain (both returning a string as well as a list of messages).

ChatMessageHistory#
One of the core utility classes underpinning most (if not all) memory modules is the ChatMessageHistory class. This is a super lightweight wrapper which exposes convenience methods for saving Human messages, AI messages, and then fetching them all.
You may want to use this class directly if you are managing memory outside of a chain.


from langchain.memory import ChatMessageHistory

history = ChatMessageHistory()

history.add_user_message(""hi!"")

history.add_ai_message(""whats up?"")













history.messages











[HumanMessage(content='hi!', additional_kwargs={}),
 AIMessage(content='whats up?', additional_kwargs={})]













ConversationBufferMemory#
We now show how to use this simple concept in a chain. We first showcase ConversationBufferMemory which is just a wrapper around ChatMessageHistory that extracts the messages in a variable.
We can first extract it as a string.


from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory













memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"")
memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""whats up?"")













memory.load_memory_variables({})











{'history': 'Human: hi!\nAI: whats up?'}











We can also get the history as a list of messages


memory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True)
memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"")
memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""whats up?"")













memory.load_memory_variables({})











{'history': [HumanMessage(content='hi!', additional_kwargs={}),
AIMessage(content='whats up?', additional_kwargs={})]}













Using in a chain#
Finally, let’s take a look at using this in a chain (setting verbose=True so we can see the prompt).


from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain


llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
conversation = ConversationChain(
llm=llm,

Saving Message History#
You may often have to save messages, and then load them to use again. This can be done easily by first converting the messages to normal python dictionaries, saving those (as json or something) and then loading those. Here is an example of doing that.


import json

from langchain.memory import ChatMessageHistory
from langchain.schema import messages_from_dict, messages_to_dict

history = ChatMessageHistory()

history.add_user_message(""hi!"")

history.add_ai_message(""whats up?"")













dicts = messages_to_dict(history.messages)













dicts











[{'type': 'human', 'data': {'content': 'hi!', 'additional_kwargs': {}}},
 {'type': 'ai', 'data': {'content': 'whats up?', 'additional_kwargs': {}}}]













new_messages = messages_from_dict(dicts)













new_messages











[HumanMessage(content='hi!', additional_kwargs={}),
 AIMessage(content='whats up?', additional_kwargs={})]











And that’s it for the getting started! There are plenty of different types of memory, check out our examples to see them all"
,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/memory.html,"Memory#

Note
Conceptual Guide

By default, Chains and Agents are stateless,
meaning that they treat each incoming query independently (as are the underlying LLMs and chat models).
In some applications (chatbots being a GREAT example) it is highly important
to remember previous interactions, both at a short term but also at a long term level.
The Memory does exactly that.
LangChain provides memory components in two forms.
First, LangChain provides helper utilities for managing and manipulating previous chat messages.
These are designed to be modular and useful regardless of how they are used.
Secondly, LangChain provides easy ways to incorporate these utilities into chains.





Getting Started: An overview of different types of memory.
How-To Guides: A collection of how-to guides. These highlight different types of memory, as well as how to use memory in chains."
,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/prompts/output_parsers/examples/structured.html,"Structured Output Parser#
While the Pydantic/JSON parser is more powerful, we initially experimented data structures having text fields only.


from langchain.output_parsers import StructuredOutputParser, ResponseSchema
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate, ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI











Here we define the response schema we want to receive.


response_schemas = [
ResponseSchema(name=""answer"", description=""answer to the user's question""),
ResponseSchema(name=""source"", description=""source used to answer the user's question, should be a website."")
]
output_parser = StructuredOutputParser.from_response_schemas(response_schemas)











We now get a string that contains instructions for how the response should be formatted, and we then insert that into our prompt.


format_instructions = output_parser.get_format_instructions()
prompt = PromptTemplate(
template=""answer the users question as best as possible.\n{format_instructions}\n{question}"",
input_variables=[""question""],
partial_variables={""format_instructions"": format_instructions}
)











We can now use this to format a prompt to send to the language model, and then parse the returned result.


model = OpenAI(temperature=0)













_input = prompt.format_prompt(question=""what's the capital of france?"")
output = model(_input.to_string())













output_parser.parse(output)











{'answer': 'Paris',
 'source': 'https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-is-the-capital-of-france.html'}











And here’s an example of using this in a chat model


chat_model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)













prompt = ChatPromptTemplate(
messages=[
HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""answer the users question as best as possible.\n{format_instructions}\n{question}"")
],
input_variables=[""question""],
partial_variables={""format_instructions"": format_instructions}
)













_input = prompt.format_prompt(question=""what's the capital of france?"")
output = chat_model(_input.to_messages())













output_parser.parse(output.content)

Language models output text. But many times you may want to get more structured information than just text back. This is where output parsers come in.
Output parsers are classes that help structure language model responses. There are two main methods an output parser must implement:

get_format_instructions() -> str: A method which returns a string containing instructions for how the output of a language model should be formatted.
parse(str) -> Any: A method which takes in a string (assumed to be the response from a language model) and parses it into some structure.

And then one optional one:

parse_with_prompt(str, PromptValue) -> Any: A method which takes in a string (assumed to be the response from a language model) and a prompt (assumed to the prompt that generated such a response) and parses it into some structure. The prompt is largely provided in the event the OutputParser wants to retry or fix the output in some way, and needs information from the prompt to do so.

Below we go over the main type of output parser, the PydanticOutputParser. See the examples folder for other options.

In this tutorial, we’ll create a custom example selector that selects every alternate example from a given list of examples.
An ExampleSelector must implement two methods:

An add_example method which takes in an example and adds it into the ExampleSelector
A select_examples method which takes in input variables (which are meant to be user input) and returns a list of examples to use in the few shot prompt.

Let’s implement a custom ExampleSelector that just selects two examples at random.

Note
Conceptual Guide

If you have a large number of examples, you may need to select which ones to include in the prompt. The ExampleSelector is the class responsible for doing so.
The base interface is defined as below:
class BaseExampleSelector(ABC):
""""""Interface for selecting examples to include in prompts.""""""

@abstractmethod
def select_examples(self, input_variables: Dict[str, str]) -> List[dict]:
""""""Select which examples to use based on the inputs.""""""









The only method it needs to expose is a select_examples method. This takes in the input variables and then returns a list of examples. It is up to each specific implementation as to how those examples are selected. Let’s take a look at some below.

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/prompts/chat_prompt_template.html,"Chat Prompt Templates#
Chat Models take a list of chat messages as input - this list commonly referred to as a prompt.
These chat messages differ from raw string (which you would pass into a LLM model) in that every message is associated with a role.
For example, in OpenAI Chat Completion API, a chat message can be associated with the AI, human or system role. The model is supposed to follow instruction from system chat message more closely.
LangChain provides several prompt templates to make constructing and working with prompts easily. You are encouraged to use these chat related prompt templates instead of PromptTemplate when querying chat models to fully exploit the potential of underlying chat model.


from langchain.prompts import (
ChatPromptTemplate,
PromptTemplate,
SystemMessagePromptTemplate,
AIMessagePromptTemplate,
HumanMessagePromptTemplate,
)
from langchain.schema import (
AIMessage,
HumanMessage,
SystemMessage
)











To create a message template associated with a role, you use MessagePromptTemplate.
For convenience, there is a from_template method exposed on the template. If you were to use this template, this is what it would look like:


template=""You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}.""
system_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(template)
human_template=""{text}""
human_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template)











If you wanted to construct the MessagePromptTemplate more directly, you could create a PromptTemplate outside and then pass it in, eg:


prompt=PromptTemplate(
template=""You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}."",
input_variables=[""input_language"", ""output_language""],
)
system_message_prompt_2 = SystemMessagePromptTemplate(prompt=prompt)

assert system_message_prompt == system_message_prompt_2











After that, you can build a ChatPromptTemplate from one or more MessagePromptTemplates. You can use ChatPromptTemplate’s format_prompt – this returns a PromptValue, which you can convert to a string or Message object, depending on whether you want to use the formatted value as input to an llm or chat model.


chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([system_message_prompt, human_message_prompt])

# get a chat completion from the formatted messages
chat_prompt.format_prompt(input_language=""English"", output_language=""French"", text=""I love programming."").to_messages()











[SystemMessage(content='You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.', additional_kwargs={}),
 HumanMessage(content='I love programming.', additional_kwargs={})]












Format output#
The output of the format method is available as string, list of messages and ChatPromptValue
As string:


output = chat_prompt.format(input_language=""English"", output_language=""French"", text=""I love programming."")
output











'System: You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.\nHuman: I love programming.'













# or alternatively 
output_2 = chat_prompt.format_prompt(input_language=""English"", output_language=""French"", text=""I love programming."").to_string()

assert output == output_2











As ChatPromptValue


chat_prompt.format_prompt(input_language=""English"", output_language=""French"", text=""I love programming."")











ChatPromptValue(messages=[SystemMessage(content='You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.', additional_kwargs={}), HumanMessage(content='I love programming.', additional_kwargs={})])











As list of Message objects


chat_prompt.format_prompt(input_language=""English"", output_language=""French"", text=""I love programming."").to_messages()











[SystemMessage(content='You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.', additional_kwargs={}),
 HumanMessage(content='I love programming.', additional_kwargs={})]













Different types of MessagePromptTemplate#
LangChain provides different types of MessagePromptTemplate. The most commonly used are AIMessagePromptTemplate, SystemMessagePromptTemplate and HumanMessagePromptTemplate, which create an AI message, system message and human message respectively.
However, in cases where the chat model supports taking chat message with arbitrary role, you can use ChatMessagePromptTemplate, which allows user to specify the role name.


from langchain.prompts import ChatMessagePromptTemplate

prompt = ""May the {subject} be with you""

chat_message_prompt = ChatMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(role=""Jedi"", template=prompt)
chat_message_prompt.format(subject=""force"")











ChatMessage(content='May the force be with you', additional_kwargs={}, role='Jedi')











LangChain also provides MessagesPlaceholder, which gives you full control of what messages to be rendered during formatting. This can be useful when you are uncertain of what role you should be using for your message prompt templates or when you wish to insert a list of messages during formatting.


from langchain.prompts import MessagesPlaceholder

human_prompt = ""Summarize our conversation so far in {word_count} words.""
human_message_template = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_prompt)

chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""conversation""), human_message_template])













human_message = HumanMessage(content=""What is the best way to learn programming?"")
ai_message = AIMessage(content=""""""\

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/prompts/prompt_templates/examples/prompt_serialization.html,"How to serialize prompts#
It is often preferrable to store prompts not as python code but as files. This can make it easy to share, store, and version prompts. This notebook covers how to do that in LangChain, walking through all the different types of prompts and the different serialization options.
At a high level, the following design principles are applied to serialization:

Both JSON and YAML are supported. We want to support serialization methods that are human readable on disk, and YAML and JSON are two of the most popular methods for that. Note that this rule applies to prompts. For other assets, like Examples, different serialization methods may be supported.
We support specifying everything in one file, or storing different components (templates, examples, etc) in different files and referencing them. For some cases, storing everything in file makes the most sense, but for others it is preferrable to split up some of the assets (long templates, large examples, reusable components). LangChain supports both.

There is also a single entry point to load prompts from disk, making it easy to load any type of prompt.


# All prompts are loaded through the `load_prompt` function.
from langchain.prompts import load_prompt












PromptTemplate#
This section covers examples for loading a PromptTemplate.

Loading from YAML#
This shows an example of loading a PromptTemplate from YAML.


!cat simple_prompt.yaml

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/prompts/prompt_templates/examples/partial.html,"How to work with partial Prompt Templates#
A prompt template is a class with a .format method which takes in a key-value map and returns a string (a prompt) to pass to the language model. Like other methods, it can make sense to “partial” a prompt template - eg pass in a subset of the required values, as to create a new prompt template which expects only the remaining subset of values.
LangChain supports this in two ways: we allow for partially formatted prompts (1) with string values, (2) with functions that return string values. These two different ways support different use cases. In the documentation below we go over the motivations for both use cases as well as how to do it in LangChain.

Partial With Strings#
One common use case for wanting to partial a prompt template is if you get some of the variables before others. For example, suppose you have a prompt template that requires two variables, foo and baz. If you get the foo value early on in the chain, but the baz value later, it can be annoying to wait until you have both variables in the same place to pass them to the prompt template. Instead, you can partial the prompt template with the foo value, and then pass the partialed prompt template along and just use that. Below is an example of doing this:


from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate













prompt = PromptTemplate(template=""{foo}{bar}"", input_variables=[""foo"", ""bar""])
partial_prompt = prompt.partial(foo=""foo"");
print(partial_prompt.format(bar=""baz""))











foobaz











You can also just initialize the prompt with the partialed variables.


prompt = PromptTemplate(template=""{foo}{bar}"", input_variables=[""bar""], partial_variables={""foo"": ""foo""})
print(prompt.format(bar=""baz""))











foobaz













Partial With Functions#
The other common use is to partial with a function. The use case for this is when you have a variable you know that you always want to fetch in a common way. A prime example of this is with date or time. Imagine you have a prompt which you always want to have the current date. You can’t hard code it in the prompt, and passing it along with the other input variables is a bit annoying. In this case, it’s very handy to be able to partial the prompt with a function that always returns the current date.


from datetime import datetime

def _get_datetime():
now = datetime.now()
return now.strftime(""%m/%d/%Y, %H:%M:%S"")













prompt = PromptTemplate(
template=""Tell me a {adjective} joke about the day {date}"", 
input_variables=[""adjective"", ""date""]
);
partial_prompt = prompt.partial(date=_get_datetime)
print(partial_prompt.format(adjective=""funny""))











Tell me a funny joke about the day 02/27/2023, 22:15:16











You can also just initialize the prompt with the partialed variables, which often makes more sense in this workflow.


prompt = PromptTemplate(
template=""Tell me a {adjective} joke about the day {date}"", 
input_variables=[""adjective""],
partial_variables={""date"": _get_datetime}
);
print(prompt.format(adjective=""funny""))











Tell me a funny joke about the day 02/27/2023, 22:15:16

Using an example selector#

Feed examples into ExampleSelector#
We will reuse the example set and the formatter from the previous section. However, instead of feeding the examples directly into the FewShotPromptTemplate object, we will feed them into an ExampleSelector object.
In this tutorial, we will use the SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector class. This class selects few shot examples based on their similarity to the input. It uses an embedding model to compute the similarity between the input and the few shot examples, as well as a vector store to perform the nearest neighbor search.


from langchain.prompts.example_selector import SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings


example_selector = SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector.from_examples(
# This is the list of examples available to select from.
examples,
# This is the embedding class used to produce embeddings which are used to measure semantic similarity.
OpenAIEmbeddings(),
# This is the VectorStore class that is used to store the embeddings and do a similarity search over.
Chroma,
# This is the number of examples to produce.
k=1
)

# Select the most similar example to the input.
question = ""Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?""
selected_examples = example_selector.select_examples({""question"": question})
print(f""Examples most similar to the input: {question}"")
for example in selected_examples:
print(""\n"")
for k, v in example.items():
print(f""{k}: {v}"")

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/prompts/prompt_templates/examples/custom_prompt_template.html,"How to create a custom prompt template#
Let’s suppose we want the LLM to generate English language explanations of a function given its name. To achieve this task, we will create a custom prompt template that takes in the function name as input, and formats the prompt template to provide the source code of the function.

Why are custom prompt templates needed?#
LangChain provides a set of default prompt templates that can be used to generate prompts for a variety of tasks. However, there may be cases where the default prompt templates do not meet your needs. For example, you may want to create a prompt template with specific dynamic instructions for your language model. In such cases, you can create a custom prompt template.
Take a look at the current set of default prompt templates here.


Creating a Custom Prompt Template#
There are essentially two distinct prompt templates available - string prompt templates and chat prompt templates. String prompt templates provides a simple prompt in string format, while chat prompt templates produces a more structured prompt to be used with a chat API.
In this guide, we will create a custom prompt using a string prompt template.
To create a custom string prompt template, there are two requirements:

It has an input_variables attribute that exposes what input variables the prompt template expects.
It exposes a format method that takes in keyword arguments corresponding to the expected input_variables and returns the formatted prompt.

We will create a custom prompt template that takes in the function name as input and formats the prompt to provide the source code of the function. To achieve this, let’s first create a function that will return the source code of a function given its name.


import inspect

def get_source_code(function_name):
# Get the source code of the function
return inspect.getsource(function_name)











Next, we’ll create a custom prompt template that takes in the function name as input, and formats the prompt template to provide the source code of the function.


from langchain.prompts import StringPromptTemplate
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator


class FunctionExplainerPromptTemplate(StringPromptTemplate, BaseModel):
"""""" A custom prompt template that takes in the function name as input, and formats the prompt template to provide the source code of the function. """"""

@validator(""input_variables"")
def validate_input_variables(cls, v):
"""""" Validate that the input variables are correct. """"""
if len(v) != 1 or ""function_name"" not in v:
raise ValueError(""function_name must be the only input_variable."")
return v

def format(self, **kwargs) -> str:
# Get the source code of the function
source_code = get_source_code(kwargs[""function_name""])

# Generate the prompt to be sent to the language model
prompt = f""""""
Given the function name and source code, generate an English language explanation of the function.
Function Name: {kwargs[""function_name""].__name__}
Source Code:
{source_code}
Explanation:
""""""
return prompt

def _prompt_type(self):
return ""function-explainer""













Use the custom prompt template#
Now that we have created a custom prompt template, we can use it to generate prompts for our task.


fn_explainer = FunctionExplainerPromptTemplate(input_variables=[""function_name""])

# Generate a prompt for the function ""get_source_code""
prompt = fn_explainer.format(function_name=get_source_code)
print(prompt)











Given the function name and source code, generate an English language explanation of the function.
Function Name: get_source_code

def get_source_code(function_name):
# Get the source code of the function
return inspect.getsource(function_name)

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/prompts/prompt_templates/examples/connecting_to_a_feature_store.html,"Connecting to a Feature Store#
Feature stores are a concept from traditional machine learning that make sure data fed into models is up-to-date and relevant. For more on this, see here.
This concept is extremely relevant when considering putting LLM applications in production. In order to personalize LLM applications, you may want to combine LLMs with up-to-date information about particular users. Feature stores can be a great way to keep that data fresh, and LangChain provides an easy way to combine that data with LLMs.
In this notebook we will show how to connect prompt templates to feature stores. The basic idea is to call a feature store from inside a prompt template to retrieve values that are then formatted into the prompt.

Feast#
To start, we will use the popular open source feature store framework Feast.
This assumes you have already run the steps in the README around getting started. We will build of off that example in getting started, and create and LLMChain to write a note to a specific driver regarding their up-to-date statistics.

Load Feast Store#
Again, this should be set up according to the instructions in the Feast README


from feast import FeatureStore

# You may need to update the path depending on where you stored it
feast_repo_path = ""../../../../../my_feature_repo/feature_repo/""
store = FeatureStore(repo_path=feast_repo_path)













Prompts#
Here we will set up a custom FeastPromptTemplate. This prompt template will take in a driver id, look up their stats, and format those stats into a prompt.
Note that the input to this prompt template is just driver_id, since that is the only user defined piece (all other variables are looked up inside the prompt template).


from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate, StringPromptTemplate













template = """"""Given the driver's up to date stats, write them note relaying those stats to them.

prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)













class FeastPromptTemplate(StringPromptTemplate):

def format(self, **kwargs) -> str:
driver_id = kwargs.pop(""driver_id"")
feature_vector = store.get_online_features(
features=[
'driver_hourly_stats:conv_rate',
'driver_hourly_stats:acc_rate',

And remember, even chickens can't always cross the road, but they still give it their best shot.""














Tecton#
Above, we showed how you could use Feast, a popular open source and self-managed feature store, with LangChain. Our examples below will show a similar integration using Tecton. Tecton is a fully managed feature platform built to orchestrate the complete ML feature lifecycle, from transformation to online serving, with enterprise-grade SLAs.

Prerequisites#

Tecton Deployment (sign up at https://tecton.ai)
TECTON_API_KEY environment variable set to a valid Service Account key



Define and Load Features#
We will use the user_transaction_counts Feature View from the Tecton tutorial as part of a Feature Service. For simplicity, we are only using a single Feature View; however, more sophisticated applications may require more feature views to retrieve the features needed for its prompt.
user_transaction_metrics = FeatureService(
name = ""user_transaction_metrics"",
features = [user_transaction_counts]
)









The above Feature Service is expected to be applied to a live workspace. For this example, we will be using the “prod” workspace.


import tecton

workspace = tecton.get_workspace(""prod"")
feature_service = workspace.get_feature_service(""user_transaction_metrics"")













Prompts#
Here we will set up a custom TectonPromptTemplate. This prompt template will take in a user_id , look up their stats, and format those stats into a prompt.
Note that the input to this prompt template is just user_id, since that is the only user defined piece (all other variables are looked up inside the prompt template).


from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate, StringPromptTemplate

Featureform#
Finally, we will use Featureform an open-source and enterprise-grade feature store to run the same example. Featureform allows you to work with your infrastructure like Spark or locally to define your feature transformations.

Initialize Featureform#
You can follow in the instructions in the README to initialize your transformations and features in Featureform.


import featureform as ff

client = ff.Client(host=""demo.featureform.com"")













Prompts#
Here we will set up a custom FeatureformPromptTemplate. This prompt template will take in the average amount a user pays per transactions.
Note that the input to this prompt template is just avg_transaction, since that is the only user defined piece (all other variables are looked up inside the prompt template).


from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate, StringPromptTemplate

what a prompt template is, and why it is needed,
how to create a prompt template,
how to pass few shot examples to a prompt template,
how to select examples for a prompt template.


What is a prompt template?#
A prompt template refers to a reproducible way to generate a prompt. It contains a text string (“the template”), that can take in a set of parameters from the end user and generate a prompt.
The prompt template may contain:

instructions to the language model,
a set of few shot examples to help the language model generate a better response,
a question to the language model.

The following code snippet contains an example of a prompt template:
from langchain import PromptTemplate


template = """"""
I want you to act as a naming consultant for new companies.
What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?
""""""

prompt = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=[""product""],
template=template,
)
prompt.format(product=""colorful socks"")
# -> I want you to act as a naming consultant for new companies.
# -> What is a good name for a company that makes colorful socks?











Create a prompt template#
You can create simple hardcoded prompts using the PromptTemplate class. Prompt templates can take any number of input variables, and can be formatted to generate a prompt.
from langchain import PromptTemplate

# An example prompt with no input variables
no_input_prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[], template=""Tell me a joke."")
no_input_prompt.format()
# -> ""Tell me a joke.""

# An example prompt with one input variable
one_input_prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[""adjective""], template=""Tell me a {adjective} joke."")
one_input_prompt.format(adjective=""funny"")
# -> ""Tell me a funny joke.""

# An example prompt with multiple input variables
multiple_input_prompt = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=[""adjective"", ""content""], 
template=""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}.""
)
multiple_input_prompt.format(adjective=""funny"", content=""chickens"")
# -> ""Tell me a funny joke about chickens.""









If you do not wish to specify input_variables manually, you can also create a PromptTemplate using from_template class method. langchain will automatically infer the input_variables based on the template passed.
template = ""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}.""

prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)
prompt_template.input_variables
# -> ['adjective', 'content']
prompt_template.format(adjective=""funny"", content=""chickens"")
# -> Tell me a funny joke about chickens.









You can create custom prompt templates that format the prompt in any way you want. For more information, see Custom Prompt Templates.



Template formats#
By default, PromptTemplate will treat the provided template as a Python f-string. You can specify other template format through template_format argument:
# Make sure jinja2 is installed before running this

jinja2_template = ""Tell me a {{ adjective }} joke about {{ content }}""
prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template(template=jinja2_template, template_format=""jinja2"")

prompt_template.format(adjective=""funny"", content=""chickens"")
# -> Tell me a funny joke about chickens.









Currently, PromptTemplate only supports jinja2 and f-string templating format. If there is any other templating format that you would like to use, feel free to open an issue in the Github page.


Validate template#
By default, PromptTemplate will validate the template string by checking whether the input_variables match the variables defined in template. You can disable this behavior by setting validate_template to False
template = ""I am learning langchain because {reason}.""

prompt_template = PromptTemplate(template=template, 
 input_variables=[""reason"", ""foo""]) # ValueError due to extra variables
prompt_template = PromptTemplate(template=template, 
 input_variables=[""reason"", ""foo""], 
 validate_template=False) # No error











Serialize prompt template#
You can save your PromptTemplate into a file in your local filesystem. langchain will automatically infer the file format through the file extension name. Currently, langchain supports saving template to YAML and JSON file.
prompt_template.save(""awesome_prompt.json"") # Save to JSON file









from langchain.prompts import load_prompt
loaded_prompt = load_prompt(""awesome_prompt.json"")

assert prompt_template == loaded_prompt









langchain also supports loading prompt template from LangChainHub, which contains a collection of useful prompts you can use in your project. You can read more about LangChainHub and the prompts available with it here.

from langchain.prompts import load_prompt

prompt = load_prompt(""lc://prompts/conversation/prompt.json"")
prompt.format(history="""", input=""What is 1 + 1?"")









You can learn more about serializing prompt template in How to serialize prompts.


Pass few shot examples to a prompt template#
Few shot examples are a set of examples that can be used to help the language model generate a better response.
To generate a prompt with few shot examples, you can use the FewShotPromptTemplate. This class takes in a PromptTemplate and a list of few shot examples. It then formats the prompt template with the few shot examples.
In this example, we’ll create a prompt to generate word antonyms.
from langchain import PromptTemplate, FewShotPromptTemplate

# First, create the list of few shot examples.
examples = [
{""word"": ""happy"", ""antonym"": ""sad""},
{""word"": ""tall"", ""antonym"": ""short""},
]

# Next, we specify the template to format the examples we have provided.
# We use the `PromptTemplate` class for this.
example_formatter_template = """"""Word: {word}
Antonym: {antonym}
""""""

example_prompt = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=[""word"", ""antonym""],
template=example_formatter_template,
)

# Finally, we create the `FewShotPromptTemplate` object.
few_shot_prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(
# These are the examples we want to insert into the prompt.
examples=examples,
# This is how we want to format the examples when we insert them into the prompt.
example_prompt=example_prompt,
# The prefix is some text that goes before the examples in the prompt.
# Usually, this consists of intructions.
prefix=""Give the antonym of every input\n"",
# The suffix is some text that goes after the examples in the prompt.
# Usually, this is where the user input will go
suffix=""Word: {input}\nAntonym: "",
# The input variables are the variables that the overall prompt expects.
input_variables=[""input""],
# The example_separator is the string we will use to join the prefix, examples, and suffix together with.
example_separator=""\n"",
)

# We can now generate a prompt using the `format` method.
print(few_shot_prompt.format(input=""big""))
# -> Give the antonym of every input
# -> 
# -> Word: happy
# -> Antonym: sad
# ->
# -> Word: tall
# -> Antonym: short
# ->
# -> Word: big
# -> Antonym: 











Select examples for a prompt template#
If you have a large number of examples, you can use the ExampleSelector to select a subset of examples that will be most informative for the Language Model. This will help you generate a prompt that is more likely to generate a good response.
Below, we’ll use the LengthBasedExampleSelector, which selects examples based on the length of the input. This is useful when you are worried about constructing a prompt that will go over the length of the context window. For longer inputs, it will select fewer examples to include, while for shorter inputs it will select more.
We’ll continue with the example from the previous section, but this time we’ll use the LengthBasedExampleSelector to select the examples.
from langchain.prompts.example_selector import LengthBasedExampleSelector


# These are a lot of examples of a pretend task of creating antonyms.
examples = [
{""word"": ""happy"", ""antonym"": ""sad""},
{""word"": ""tall"", ""antonym"": ""short""},
{""word"": ""energetic"", ""antonym"": ""lethargic""},
{""word"": ""sunny"", ""antonym"": ""gloomy""},
{""word"": ""windy"", ""antonym"": ""calm""},
]

# We'll use the `LengthBasedExampleSelector` to select the examples.
example_selector = LengthBasedExampleSelector(
# These are the examples is has available to choose from.
examples=examples, 
# This is the PromptTemplate being used to format the examples.
example_prompt=example_prompt, 
# This is the maximum length that the formatted examples should be.
# Length is measured by the get_text_length function below.
max_length=25
# This is the function used to get the length of a string, which is used
# to determine which examples to include. It is commented out because
# it is provided as a default value if none is specified.
# get_text_length: Callable[[str], int] = lambda x: len(re.split(""\n| "", x))
)

# We can now use the `example_selector` to create a `FewShotPromptTemplate`.
dynamic_prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(
# We provide an ExampleSelector instead of examples.
example_selector=example_selector,
example_prompt=example_prompt,
prefix=""Give the antonym of every input"",
suffix=""Word: {input}\nAntonym:"",
input_variables=[""input""],
example_separator=""\n\n"",
)

# We can now generate a prompt using the `format` method.
print(dynamic_prompt.format(input=""big""))
# -> Give the antonym of every input
# ->
# -> Word: happy
# -> Antonym: sad
# ->
# -> Word: tall
# -> Antonym: short
# ->
# -> Word: energetic
# -> Antonym: lethargic
# ->
# -> Word: sunny
# -> Antonym: gloomy
# ->
# -> Word: windy
# -> Antonym: calm
# ->
# -> Word: big
# -> Antonym:









In contrast, if we provide a very long input, the LengthBasedExampleSelector will select fewer examples to include in the prompt.
long_string = ""big and huge and massive and large and gigantic and tall and much much much much much bigger than everything else""
print(dynamic_prompt.format(input=long_string))
# -> Give the antonym of every input

# -> Word: happy
# -> Antonym: sad
# ->
# -> Word: big and huge and massive and large and gigantic and tall and much much much much much bigger than everything else
# -> Antonym:










LangChain comes with a few example selectors that you can use. For more details on how to use them, see Example Selectors.
You can create custom example selectors that select examples based on any criteria you want. For more details on how to do this, see Creating a custom example selector."

Conceptual Guide

Language models take text as input - that text is commonly referred to as a prompt.
Typically this is not simply a hardcoded string but rather a combination of a template, some examples, and user input.
LangChain provides several classes and functions to make constructing and working with prompts easy.
The following sections of documentation are provided:

Getting Started: An overview of all the functionality LangChain provides for working with and constructing prompts.
How-To Guides: A collection of how-to guides. These highlight how to accomplish various objectives with our prompt class.
Reference: API reference documentation for all prompt classes."
,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/prompts/getting_started.html,"Getting Started#
This section contains everything related to prompts. A prompt is the value passed into the Language Model. This value can either be a string (for LLMs) or a list of messages (for Chat Models).
The data types of these prompts are rather simple, but their construction is anything but. Value props of LangChain here include:

A standard interface for string prompts and message prompts
A standard (to get started) interface for string prompt templates and message prompt templates
Example Selectors: methods for inserting examples into the prompt for the language model to follow
OutputParsers: methods for inserting instructions into the prompt as the format in which the language model should output information, as well as methods for then parsing that string output into a format.

We have in depth documentation for specific types of string prompts, specific types of chat prompts, example selectors, and output parsers.
Here, we cover a quick-start for a standard interface for getting started with simple prompts.

PromptTemplates#
PromptTemplates are responsible for constructing a prompt value. These PromptTemplates can do things like formatting, example selection, and more. At a high level, these are basically objects that expose a format_prompt method for constructing a prompt. Under the hood, ANYTHING can happen.


from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate, ChatPromptTemplate













string_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""tell me a joke about {subject}"")













chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(""tell me a joke about {subject}"")













string_prompt_value = string_prompt.format_prompt(subject=""soccer"")













chat_prompt_value = chat_prompt.format_prompt(subject=""soccer"")













to_string#
This is what is called when passing to an LLM (which expects raw text)


string_prompt_value.to_string()











'tell me a joke about soccer'













chat_prompt_value.to_string()











'Human: tell me a joke about soccer'













to_messages#
This is what is called when passing to ChatModel (which expects a list of messages)


string_prompt_value.to_messages()

Conceptual Guide

The new way of programming models is through prompts.
A prompt refers to the input to the model.
This input is often constructed from multiple components.
A PromptTemplate is responsible for the construction of this input.
LangChain provides several classes and functions to make constructing and working with prompts easy.





Getting Started: An overview of the prompts.
LLM Prompt Templates: How to use PromptTemplates to prompt Language Models.
Chat Prompt Templates: How to use PromptTemplates to prompt Chat Models.
Example Selectors: Often times it is useful to include examples in prompts.
These examples can be dynamically selected. This section goes over example selection.
Output Parsers: Language models (and Chat Models) output text.
But many times you may want to get more structured information. This is where output parsers come in.
Output Parsers:

instruct the model how output should be formatted,
parse output into the desired formatting (including retrying if necessary)."

Conceptual Guide

This documentation goes over how to use the Embedding class in LangChain.
The Embedding class is a class designed for interfacing with embeddings. There are lots of Embedding providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc) - this class is designed to provide a standard interface for all of them.
Embeddings create a vector representation of a piece of text. This is useful because it means we can think about text in the vector space, and do things like semantic search where we look for pieces of text that are most similar in the vector space.
The base Embedding class in LangChain exposes two methods: embed_documents and embed_query. The largest difference is that these two methods have different interfaces: one works over multiple documents, while the other works over a single document. Besides this, another reason for having these as two separate methods is that some embedding providers have different embedding methods for documents (to be searched over) vs queries (the search query itself).
The following integrations exist for text embeddings.

Amazon Bedrock
Azure OpenAI
Cohere

PromptLayer
is a devtool that allows you to track, manage, and share your GPT prompt engineering.
It acts as a middleware between your code and OpenAI’s python library, recording all your API requests
and saving relevant metadata for easy exploration and search in the PromptLayer dashboard.


Install PromptLayer#
The promptlayer package is required to use PromptLayer with OpenAI. Install promptlayer using pip.


pip install promptlayer













Imports#


import os
from langchain.chat_models import PromptLayerChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage













Set the Environment API Key#
You can create a PromptLayer API Key at www.promptlayer.com by clicking the settings cog in the navbar.
Set it as an environment variable called PROMPTLAYER_API_KEY.


os.environ[""PROMPTLAYER_API_KEY""] = ""**********""













Use the PromptLayerOpenAI LLM like normal#
You can optionally pass in pl_tags to track your requests with PromptLayer’s tagging feature.


chat = PromptLayerChatOpenAI(pl_tags=[""langchain""])
chat([HumanMessage(content=""I am a cat and I want"")])











AIMessage(content='to take a nap in a cozy spot. I search around for a suitable place and finally settle on a soft cushion on the window sill. I curl up into a ball and close my eyes, relishing the warmth of the sun on my fur. As I drift off to sleep, I can hear the birds chirping outside and feel the gentle breeze blowing through the window. This is the life of a contented cat.', additional_kwargs={})











The above request should now appear on your PromptLayer dashboard.


Using PromptLayer Track#
If you would like to use any of the PromptLayer tracking features, you need to pass the argument return_pl_id when instantializing the PromptLayer LLM to get the request id.


chat = PromptLayerChatOpenAI(return_pl_id=True)
chat_results = chat.generate([[HumanMessage(content=""I am a cat and I want"")]])

for res in chat_results.generations:
pl_request_id = res[0].generation_info[""pl_request_id""]
promptlayer.track.score(request_id=pl_request_id, score=100)











Using this allows you to track the performance of your model in the PromptLayer dashboard. If you are using a prompt template, you can attach a template to a request as well.
Overall, this gives you the opportunity to track the performance of different templates and models in the PromptLayer dashboard."

There does not appear to be solid consensus on how best to do few shot prompting. As a result, we are not solidifying any abstractions around this yet but rather using existing abstractions.

Alternating Human/AI messages#
The first way of doing few shot prompting relies on using alternating human/ai messages. See an example of this below.


from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain
from langchain.prompts.chat import (
ChatPromptTemplate,
SystemMessagePromptTemplate,

""I be lovin' programmin', me hearty!""













System Messages#
OpenAI provides an optional name parameter that they also recommend using in conjunction with system messages to do few shot prompting. Here is an example of how to do that below.


template=""You are a helpful assistant that translates english to pirate.""
system_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(template)
example_human = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""Hi"", additional_kwargs={""name"": ""example_user""})

)
from langchain.schema import (

)













chat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)











You can get chat completions by passing one or more messages to the chat model. The response will be a message. The types of messages currently supported in LangChain are AIMessage, HumanMessage, SystemMessage, and ChatMessage – ChatMessage takes in an arbitrary role parameter. Most of the time, you’ll just be dealing with HumanMessage, AIMessage, and SystemMessage


chat([HumanMessage(content=""Translate this sentence from English to French. I love programming."")])











AIMessage(content=""J'aime programmer."", additional_kwargs={})











OpenAI’s chat model supports multiple messages as input. See here for more information. Here is an example of sending a system and user message to the chat model:


messages = [
SystemMessage(content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.""),
HumanMessage(content=""I love programming."")
]
chat(messages)











AIMessage(content=""J'aime programmer."", additional_kwargs={})











You can go one step further and generate completions for multiple sets of messages using generate. This returns an LLMResult with an additional message parameter.


batch_messages = [
[
SystemMessage(content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.""),
HumanMessage(content=""I love programming."")
],
[
SystemMessage(content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.""),
HumanMessage(content=""I love artificial intelligence."")
],
]
result = chat.generate(batch_messages)
result











LLMResult(generations=[[ChatGeneration(text=""J'aime programmer."", generation_info=None, message=AIMessage(content=""J'aime programmer."", additional_kwargs={}))], [ChatGeneration(text=""J'aime l'intelligence artificielle."", generation_info=None, message=AIMessage(content=""J'aime l'intelligence artificielle."", additional_kwargs={}))]], llm_output={'token_usage': {'prompt_tokens': 57, 'completion_tokens': 20, 'total_tokens': 77}})











You can recover things like token usage from this LLMResult


result.llm_output











{'token_usage': {'prompt_tokens': 57,
'completion_tokens': 20,
'total_tokens': 77}}












PromptTemplates#
You can make use of templating by using a MessagePromptTemplate. You can build a ChatPromptTemplate from one or more MessagePromptTemplates. You can use ChatPromptTemplate’s format_prompt – this returns a PromptValue, which you can convert to a string or Message object, depending on whether you want to use the formatted value as input to an llm or chat model.
For convenience, there is a from_template method exposed on the template. If you were to use this template, this is what it would look like:


template=""You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}.""
system_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(template)
human_template=""{text}""
human_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template)













chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([system_message_prompt, human_message_prompt])

# get a chat completion from the formatted messages
chat(chat_prompt.format_prompt(input_language=""English"", output_language=""French"", text=""I love programming."").to_messages())











AIMessage(content=""J'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={})











If you wanted to construct the MessagePromptTemplate more directly, you could create a PromptTemplate outside and then pass it in, eg:


prompt=PromptTemplate(
template=""You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}."",
input_variables=[""input_language"", ""output_language""],
)
system_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate(prompt=prompt)













LLMChain#
You can use the existing LLMChain in a very similar way to before - provide a prompt and a model.


chain = LLMChain(llm=chat, prompt=chat_prompt)













chain.run(input_language=""English"", output_language=""French"", text=""I love programming."")











""J'adore la programmation.""













Streaming#
Streaming is supported for ChatOpenAI through callback handling.


from langchain.callbacks.streaming_stdout import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler
chat = ChatOpenAI(streaming=True, callbacks=[StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()], temperature=0)
resp = chat([HumanMessage(content=""Write me a song about sparkling water."")])

While chat models use language models under the hood, the interface they expose is a bit different.
Rather than expose a “text in, text out” API, they expose an interface where “chat messages” are the inputs and outputs.

Replicate runs machine learning models in the cloud. We have a library of open-source models that you can run with a few lines of code. If you’re building your own machine learning models, Replicate makes it easy to deploy them at scale.

This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with Replicate models

Setup#
To run this notebook, you’ll need to create a replicate account and install the replicate python client.


!pip install replicate













# get a token: https://replicate.com/account

REPLICATE_API_TOKEN = getpass()











 ········













import os

os.environ[""REPLICATE_API_TOKEN""] = REPLICATE_API_TOKEN













from langchain.llms import Replicate
from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain













Calling a model#
Find a model on the replicate explore page, and then paste in the model name and version in this format: model_name/version
For example, for this dolly model, click on the API tab. The model name/version would be: replicate/dolly-v2-12b:ef0e1aefc61f8e096ebe4db6b2bacc297daf2ef6899f0f7e001ec445893500e5
Only the model param is required, but we can add other model params when initializing.
For example, if we were running stable diffusion and wanted to change the image dimensions:
Replicate(model=""stability-ai/stable-diffusion:db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf"", input={'image_dimensions': '512x512'})









Note that only the first output of a model will be returned.


llm = Replicate(model=""replicate/dolly-v2-12b:ef0e1aefc61f8e096ebe4db6b2bacc297daf2ef6899f0f7e001ec445893500e5"")













prompt = """"""
Answer the following yes/no question by reasoning step by step. 
Can a dog drive a car?
""""""
llm(prompt)











'The legal driving age of dogs is 2. Cars are designed for humans to drive. Therefore, the final answer is yes.'











We can call any replicate model using this syntax. For example, we can call stable diffusion.


text2image = Replicate(model=""stability-ai/stable-diffusion:db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf"",

image_output = text2image(""A cat riding a motorcycle by Picasso"")
image_output











'https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/Cf07B1zqzFQLOSBQcKG7m9beE74wf7kuip5W9VxHJFembefKE/out-0.png'











The model spits out a URL. Let’s render it.


from PIL import Image
import requests
from io import BytesIO

response = requests.get(image_output)
img = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))

Chaining Calls#
The whole point of langchain is to… chain! Here’s an example of how do that.


from langchain.chains import SimpleSequentialChain











First, let’s define the LLM for this model as a flan-5, and text2image as a stable diffusion model.


dolly_llm = Replicate(model=""replicate/dolly-v2-12b:ef0e1aefc61f8e096ebe4db6b2bacc297daf2ef6899f0f7e001ec445893500e5"")
text2image = Replicate(model=""stability-ai/stable-diffusion:db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf"")











First prompt in the chain


prompt = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=[""product""],
template=""What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?"",
)

chain = LLMChain(llm=dolly_llm, prompt=prompt)











Second prompt to get the logo for company description


second_prompt = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=[""company_name""],
template=""Write a description of a logo for this company: {company_name}"",
)
chain_two = LLMChain(llm=dolly_llm, prompt=second_prompt)











Third prompt, let’s create the image based on the description output from prompt 2


third_prompt = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=[""company_logo_description""],
template=""{company_logo_description}"",
)
chain_three = LLMChain(llm=text2image, prompt=third_prompt)











Now let’s run it!


# Run the chain specifying only the input variable for the first chain.

ReLLM is a library that wraps local Hugging Face pipeline models for structured decoding.
It works by generating tokens one at a time. At each step, it masks tokens that don’t conform to the provided partial regular expression.

Warning - this module is still experimental


!pip install rellm > /dev/null












Hugging Face Baseline#
First, let’s establish a qualitative baseline by checking the output of the model without structured decoding.

original_model = HuggingFacePipeline(pipeline=hf_model)

generated = original_model.generate([prompt], stop=[""Human:""])

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.









generations=[[Generation(text=' ""What\'s the capital of Maryland?""\n', generation_info=None)]] llm_output=None











That’s not so impressive, is it? It didn’t answer the question and it didn’t follow the JSON format at all! Let’s try with the structured decoder.


RELLM LLM Wrapper#
Let’s try that again, now providing a regex to match the JSON structured format.


import regex # Note this is the regex library NOT python's re stdlib module

# We'll choose a regex that matches to a structured json string that looks like:
# {
#""action"": ""Final Answer"",
# ""action_input"": string or dict
# }
pattern = regex.compile(r'\{\s*""action"":\s*""Final Answer"",\s*""action_input"":\s*(\{.*\}|""[^""]*"")\s*\}\nHuman:')













from langchain.experimental.llms import RELLM

model = RELLM(pipeline=hf_model, regex=pattern, max_new_tokens=200)

generated = model.predict(prompt, stop=[""Human:""])
print(generated)











{""action"": ""Final Answer"",
""action_input"": ""The capital of Maryland is Baltimore.""
}











Voila! Free of parsing errors."

PromptLayer is the first platform that allows you to track, manage, and share your GPT prompt engineering. PromptLayer acts a middleware between your code and OpenAI’s python library.
PromptLayer records all your OpenAI API requests, allowing you to search and explore request history in the PromptLayer dashboard.
This example showcases how to connect to PromptLayer to start recording your OpenAI requests.
Another example is here.

Install PromptLayer#
The promptlayer package is required to use PromptLayer with OpenAI. Install promptlayer using pip.


!pip install promptlayer













Imports#


import os
from langchain.llms import PromptLayerOpenAI
import promptlayer













Set the Environment API Key#
You can create a PromptLayer API Key at www.promptlayer.com by clicking the settings cog in the navbar.
Set it as an environment variable called PROMPTLAYER_API_KEY.
You also need an OpenAI Key, called OPENAI_API_KEY.


from getpass import getpass

PROMPTLAYER_API_KEY = getpass()















os.environ[""PROMPTLAYER_API_KEY""] = PROMPTLAYER_API_KEY













from getpass import getpass

OPENAI_API_KEY = getpass()















os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = OPENAI_API_KEY













Use the PromptLayerOpenAI LLM like normal#
You can optionally pass in pl_tags to track your requests with PromptLayer’s tagging feature.


llm = PromptLayerOpenAI(pl_tags=[""langchain""])
llm(""I am a cat and I want"")











The above request should now appear on your PromptLayer dashboard.


Using PromptLayer Track#
If you would like to use any of the PromptLayer tracking features, you need to pass the argument return_pl_id when instantializing the PromptLayer LLM to get the request id.


llm = PromptLayerOpenAI(return_pl_id=True)
llm_results = llm.generate([""Tell me a joke""])

for res in llm_results.generations:
pl_request_id = res[0].generation_info[""pl_request_id""]
promptlayer.track.score(request_id=pl_request_id, score=100)











Using this allows you to track the performance of your model in the PromptLayer dashboard. If you are using a prompt template, you can attach a template to a request as well.
Overall, this gives you the opportunity to track the performance of different templates and models in the PromptLayer dashboard."

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/models/llms/integrations/llamacpp.html,"Llama-cpp#
llama-cpp is a Python binding for llama.cpp.
It supports several LLMs.
This notebook goes over how to run llama-cpp within LangChain.

Installation#
There is a banch of options how to install the llama-cpp package:

only CPU usage
CPU + GPU (using one of many BLAS backends)


CPU only installation#


!pip install llama-cpp-python













Installation with OpenBLAS / cuBLAS / CLBlast#
lama.cpp supports multiple BLAS backends for faster processing. Use the FORCE_CMAKE=1 environment variable to force the use of cmake and install the pip package for the desired BLAS backend (source).
Example installation with cuBLAS backend:


!CMAKE_ARGS=""-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=on"" FORCE_CMAKE=1 pip install llama-cpp-python











IMPORTANT: If you have already installed a cpu only version of the package, you need to reinstall it from scratch: condiser the following command:


!CMAKE_ARGS=""-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=on"" FORCE_CMAKE=1 pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall llama-cpp-python














Usage#
Make sure you are following all instructions to install all necessary model files.
You don’t need an API_TOKEN!


from langchain.llms import LlamaCpp
from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain
from langchain.callbacks.manager import CallbackManager
from langchain.callbacks.streaming_stdout import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler











Consider using a template that suits your model! Check the models page on HuggingFace etc. to get a correct prompting template.


template = """"""Question: {question}

Answer: Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.""""""

prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=[""question""])













# Callbacks support token-wise streaming
callback_manager = CallbackManager([StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()])
# Verbose is required to pass to the callback manager

GPU#
If the installation with BLAS backend was correct, you will see an BLAS = 1 indicator in model properties.
Two of the most important parameters for use with GPU are:

n_gpu_layers - determines how many layers of the model are offloaded to your GPU.
n_batch - how many tokens are processed in parallel.

Setting these parameters correctly will dramatically improve the evaluation speed (see wrapper code for more details).


n_gpu_layers = 40 # Change this value based on your model and your GPU VRAM pool.
n_batch = 512 # Should be between 1 and n_ctx, consider the amount of VRAM in your GPU.

# Make sure the model path is correct for your system!

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/models/llms/integrations/databricks.html,"Databricks#
The Databricks Lakehouse Platform unifies data, analytics, and AI on one platform.
This example notebook shows how to wrap Databricks endpoints as LLMs in LangChain.
It supports two endpoint types:

Serving endpoint, recommended for production and development,
Cluster driver proxy app, recommended for iteractive development.



from langchain.llms import Databricks












Wrapping a serving endpoint#
Prerequisites:

An LLM was registered and deployed to a Databricks serving endpoint.
You have “Can Query” permission to the endpoint.

The expected MLflow model signature is:

inputs: [{""name"": ""prompt"", ""type"": ""string""}, {""name"": ""stop"", ""type"": ""list[string]""}]
outputs: [{""type"": ""string""}]

If the model signature is incompatible or you want to insert extra configs, you can set transform_input_fn and transform_output_fn accordingly.


# If running a Databricks notebook attached to an interactive cluster in ""single user"" 
# or ""no isolation shared"" mode, you only need to specify the endpoint name to create 
# a `Databricks` instance to query a serving endpoint in the same workspace.
llm = Databricks(endpoint_name=""dolly"")

llm(""How are you?"")











'I am happy to hear that you are in good health and as always, you are appreciated.'













llm(""How are you?"", stop=["".""])











'Good'













# Otherwise, you can manually specify the Databricks workspace hostname and personal access token 
# or set `DATABRICKS_HOST` and `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` environment variables, respectively.
# See https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/auth.html#databricks-personal-access-tokens
# We strongly recommend not exposing the API token explicitly inside a notebook.
# You can use Databricks secret manager to store your API token securely.
# See https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/databricks-utils.html#secrets-utility-dbutilssecrets

import os
os.environ[""DATABRICKS_TOKEN""] = dbutils.secrets.get(""myworkspace"", ""api_token"")

llm = Databricks(host=""myworkspace.cloud.databricks.com"", endpoint_name=""dolly"")

llm(""How are you?"")











'I am fine. Thank you!'













# If the serving endpoint accepts extra parameters like `temperature`,
# you can set them in `model_kwargs`.
llm = Databricks(endpoint_name=""dolly"", model_kwargs={""temperature"": 0.1})

llm(""How are you?"")











'I am fine.'













# Use `transform_input_fn` and `transform_output_fn` if the serving endpoint
# expects a different input schema and does not return a JSON string,
# respectively, or you want to apply a prompt template on top.

def transform_input(**request):
full_prompt = f""""""{request[""prompt""]}
Be Concise.
""""""
request[""prompt""] = full_prompt
return request

llm = Databricks(endpoint_name=""dolly"", transform_input_fn=transform_input)

llm(""How are you?"")











'I’m Excellent. You?'













Wrapping a cluster driver proxy app#
Prerequisites:

An LLM loaded on a Databricks interactive cluster in “single user” or “no isolation shared” mode.
A local HTTP server running on the driver node to serve the model at ""/"" using HTTP POST with JSON input/output.
It uses a port number between [3000, 8000] and litens to the driver IP address or simply 0.0.0.0 instead of localhost only.
You have “Can Attach To” permission to the cluster.

The expected server schema (using JSON schema) is:

inputs:
{""type"": ""object"",
 ""properties"": {
""prompt"": {""type"": ""string""},
 ""stop"": {""type"": ""array"", ""items"": {""type"": ""string""}}},
""required"": [""prompt""]}










outputs: {""type"": ""string""}

If the server schema is incompatible or you want to insert extra configs, you can use transform_input_fn and transform_output_fn accordingly.
The following is a minimal example for running a driver proxy app to serve an LLM:
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import torch
from transformers import pipeline, AutoTokenizer, StoppingCriteria

model = ""databricks/dolly-v2-3b""
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model, padding_side=""left"")
dolly = pipeline(model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, trust_remote_code=True, device_map=""auto"")
device = dolly.device

class CheckStop(StoppingCriteria):
def __init__(self, stop=None):
super().__init__()
self.stop = stop or []
self.matched = """"
self.stop_ids = [tokenizer.encode(s, return_tensors='pt').to(device) for s in self.stop]
def __call__(self, input_ids: torch.LongTensor, scores: torch.FloatTensor, **kwargs):
for i, s in enumerate(self.stop_ids):
if torch.all((s == input_ids[0][-s.shape[1]:])).item():
self.matched = self.stop[i]
return True
return False

def llm(prompt, stop=None, **kwargs):
check_stop = CheckStop(stop)
result = dolly(prompt, stopping_criteria=[check_stop], **kwargs)
return result[0][""generated_text""].rstrip(check_stop.matched)

app = Flask(""dolly"")

@app.route('/', methods=['POST'])
def serve_llm():
resp = llm(**request.json)
return jsonify(resp)

app.run(host=""0.0.0.0"", port=""7777"")









Once the server is running, you can create a Databricks instance to wrap it as an LLM.


# If running a Databricks notebook attached to the same cluster that runs the app,
# you only need to specify the driver port to create a `Databricks` instance.
llm = Databricks(cluster_driver_port=""7777"")

llm(""How are you?"")











'Hello, thank you for asking. It is wonderful to hear that you are well.'













# Otherwise, you can manually specify the cluster ID to use,
# as well as Databricks workspace hostname and personal access token.

llm = Databricks(cluster_id=""0000-000000-xxxxxxxx"", cluster_driver_port=""7777"")

llm(""How are you?"")











'I am well. You?'













# If the app accepts extra parameters like `temperature`,
# you can set them in `model_kwargs`.
llm = Databricks(cluster_driver_port=""7777"", model_kwargs={""temperature"": 0.1})

llm(""How are you?"")











'I am very well. It is a pleasure to meet you.'













# Use `transform_input_fn` and `transform_output_fn` if the app
# expects a different input schema and does not return a JSON string,
# respectively, or you want to apply a prompt template on top.

def transform_input(**request):
full_prompt = f""""""{request[""prompt""]}

The Azure OpenAI API is compatible with OpenAI’s API.The openai Python package makes it easy to use both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.You can call Azure OpenAI the same way you call OpenAI with the exceptions noted below.

API configuration#
You can configure the openai package to use Azure OpenAI using environment variables.The following is for bash:
# Set this to `azure`
export OPENAI_API_TYPE=azure
# The API version you want to use: set this to `2023-03-15-preview` for the released version.
export OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-03-15-preview
# The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.
export OPENAI_API_BASE=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com
# The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource.You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI API key>









Alternatively, you can configure the API right within your running Python environment:
import os
os.environ[""OPENAI_API_TYPE""] = ""azure""
...











Deployments#
With Azure OpenAI, you set up your own deployments of the common GPT-3 and Codex models.When calling the API, you need to specify the deployment you want to use.
Let’s say your deployment name is text-davinci-002-prod.In the openai Python API, you can specify this deployment with the engine parameter.For example:
import openai

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/models/llms/examples/streaming_llm.html,"How to stream LLM and Chat Model responses#
LangChain provides streaming support for LLMs. Currently, we support streaming for the OpenAI, ChatOpenAI, and ChatAnthropic implementations, but streaming support for other LLM implementations is on the roadmap. To utilize streaming, use a CallbackHandler that implements on_llm_new_token. In this example, we are using StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler.


from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI, ChatAnthropic
from langchain.callbacks.streaming_stdout import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage













llm = OpenAI(streaming=True, callbacks=[StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()], temperature=0)
resp = llm(""Write me a song about sparkling water."")











Verse 1
I'm sippin' on sparkling water,
It's so refreshing and light,
It's the perfect way to quench my thirst
On a hot summer night.

Chorus
Sparkling water, sparkling water,
It's the best way to stay hydrated,
It's so crisp and so clean,
It's the perfect way to stay refreshed.

Verse 2
I'm sippin' on sparkling water,
It's so bubbly and bright,
It's the perfect way to cool me down
On a hot summer night.

Chorus
Sparkling water, sparkling water,
It's the best way to stay hydrated,
It's so crisp and so clean,
It's the perfect way to stay refreshed.

Verse 3
I'm sippin' on sparkling water,
It's so light and so clear,
It's the perfect way to keep me cool
On a hot summer night.

Chorus
Sparkling water, sparkling water,
It's the best way to stay hydrated,
It's so crisp and so clean,
It's the perfect way to stay refreshed.











We still have access to the end LLMResult if using generate. However, token_usage is not currently supported for streaming.


llm.generate([""Tell me a joke.""])











Q: What did the fish say when it hit the wall?
A: Dam!









LLMResult(generations=[[Generation(text='\n\nQ: What did the fish say when it hit the wall?\nA: Dam!', generation_info={'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None})]], llm_output={'token_usage': {}, 'model_name': 'text-davinci-003'})











Here’s an example with the ChatOpenAI chat model implementation:


chat = ChatOpenAI(streaming=True, callbacks=[StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()], temperature=0)
resp = chat([HumanMessage(content=""Write me a song about sparkling water."")])











Verse 1:
Bubbles rising to the top
A refreshing drink that never stops
Clear and crisp, it's oh so pure
Sparkling water, I can't ignore

Chorus:
Sparkling water, oh how you shine
A taste so clean, it's simply divine
You quench my thirst, you make me feel alive
Sparkling water, you're my favorite vibe

Verse 2:
No sugar, no calories, just H2O
A drink that's good for me, don't you know
With lemon or lime, you're even better
Sparkling water, you're my forever

Chorus:
Sparkling water, oh how you shine
A taste so clean, it's simply divine
You quench my thirst, you make me feel alive
Sparkling water, you're my favorite vibe

Bridge:
You're my go-to drink, day or night
You make me feel so light
I'll never give you up, you're my true love
Sparkling water, you're sent from above

Chorus:
Sparkling water, oh how you shine
A taste so clean, it's simply divine
You quench my thirst, you make me feel alive
Sparkling water, you're my favorite vibe

Outro:
Sparkling water, you're the one for me
I'll never let you go, can't you see
You're my drink of choice, forevermore
Sparkling water, I adore.











Here is an example with the ChatAnthropic chat model implementation, which uses their claude model.


chat = ChatAnthropic(streaming=True, callbacks=[StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()], temperature=0)
resp = chat([HumanMessage(content=""Write me a song about sparkling water."")])











 Here is my attempt at a song about sparkling water:

Sparkling water, bubbles so bright, 
Dancing in the glass with delight.
Refreshing and crisp, a fizzy delight,
Quenching my thirst with each sip I take.
The carbonation tickles my tongue,
As the refreshing water song is sung.
Lime or lemon, a citrus twist,
Makes sparkling water such a bliss.
Healthy and hydrating, a drink so pure,
Sparkling water, always alluring.
Bubbles ascending in a stream, 
Sparkling water, you're my dream!

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/models/llms/examples/llm_serialization.html,"How to serialize LLM classes#
This notebook walks through how to write and read an LLM Configuration to and from disk. This is useful if you want to save the configuration for a given LLM (e.g., the provider, the temperature, etc).


from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.llms.loading import load_llm












Loading#
First, lets go over loading an LLM from disk. LLMs can be saved on disk in two formats: json or yaml. No matter the extension, they are loaded in the same way.


!cat llm.json











{
""model_name"": ""text-davinci-003"",
""temperature"": 0.7,
""max_tokens"": 256,
""top_p"": 1.0,
""frequency_penalty"": 0.0,
""presence_penalty"": 0.0,
""n"": 1,
""best_of"": 1,
""request_timeout"": null,
""_type"": ""openai""
}













llm = load_llm(""llm.json"")













!cat llm.yaml











_type: openai
best_of: 1
frequency_penalty: 0.0
max_tokens: 256

n: 1
presence_penalty: 0.0
request_timeout: null
temperature: 0.7
top_p: 1.0













llm = load_llm(""llm.yaml"")













Saving#
If you want to go from an LLM in memory to a serialized version of it, you can do so easily by calling the .save method. Again, this supports both json and yaml.


llm.save(""llm.json"")













llm.save(""llm.yaml"")

Momento Cache#
Use Momento to cache prompts and responses.
Requires momento to use, uncomment below to install:


# !pip install momento











You’ll need to get a Momemto auth token to use this class. This can either be passed in to a momento.CacheClient if you’d like to instantiate that directly, as a named parameter auth_token to MomentoChatMessageHistory.from_client_params, or can just be set as an environment variable MOMENTO_AUTH_TOKEN.


from datetime import timedelta

SQLAlchemy Cache#


# You can use SQLAlchemyCache to cache with any SQL database supported by SQLAlchemy.

# from langchain.cache import SQLAlchemyCache
# from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# engine = create_engine(""postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres"")
# langchain.llm_cache = SQLAlchemyCache(engine)












Custom SQLAlchemy Schemas#


# You can define your own declarative SQLAlchemyCache child class to customize the schema used for caching. For example, to support high-speed fulltext prompt indexing with Postgres, use:

from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Computed, Index, Sequence
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy_utils import TSVectorType
from langchain.cache import SQLAlchemyCache

Base = declarative_base()


class FulltextLLMCache(Base):# type: ignore
""""""Postgres table for fulltext-indexed LLM Cache""""""

__tablename__ = ""llm_cache_fulltext""
id = Column(Integer, Sequence('cache_id'), primary_key=True)
prompt = Column(String, nullable=False)
llm = Column(String, nullable=False)
idx = Column(Integer)
response = Column(String)
prompt_tsv = Column(TSVectorType(), Computed(""to_tsvector('english', llm || ' ' || prompt)"", persisted=True))
__table_args__ = (
Index(""idx_fulltext_prompt_tsv"", prompt_tsv, postgresql_using=""gin""),
)

engine = create_engine(""postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres"")
langchain.llm_cache = SQLAlchemyCache(engine, FulltextLLMCache)














Optional Caching#
You can also turn off caching for specific LLMs should you choose. In the example below, even though global caching is enabled, we turn it off for a specific LLM


llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"", n=2, best_of=2, cache=False)













%%time
llm(""Tell me a joke"")











CPU times: user 5.8 ms, sys: 2.71 ms, total: 8.51 ms
Wall time: 745 ms









'\n\nWhy did the chicken cross the road?\n\nTo get to the other side!'













%%time
llm(""Tell me a joke"")











CPU times: user 4.91 ms, sys: 2.64 ms, total: 7.55 ms
Wall time: 623 ms









'\n\nTwo guys stole a calendar. They got six months each.'













Optional Caching in Chains#
You can also turn off caching for particular nodes in chains. Note that because of certain interfaces, its often easier to construct the chain first, and then edit the LLM afterwards.
As an example, we will load a summarizer map-reduce chain. We will cache results for the map-step, but then not freeze it for the combine step.


llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"")
no_cache_llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"", cache=False)













from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.chains.mapreduce import MapReduceChain

text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter()













with open('../../../state_of_the_union.txt') as f:
state_of_the_union = f.read()
texts = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union)













from langchain.docstore.document import Document
docs = [Document(page_content=t) for t in texts[:3]]
from langchain.chains.summarize import load_summarize_chain













chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type=""map_reduce"", reduce_llm=no_cache_llm)













%%time
chain.run(docs)











CPU times: user 452 ms, sys: 60.3 ms, total: 512 ms
Wall time: 5.09 s









'\n\nPresident Biden is discussing the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which will create jobs and help Americans. He also talks about his vision for America, which includes investing in education and infrastructure. In response to Russian aggression in Ukraine, the United States is joining with European allies to impose sanctions and isolate Russia. American forces are being mobilized to protect NATO countries in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west. The Ukrainians are bravely fighting back, but the next few weeks will be hard for them. Putin will pay a high price for his actions in the long run. Americans should not be alarmed, as the United States is taking action to protect its interests and allies.'











When we run it again, we see that it runs substantially faster but the final answer is different. This is due to caching at the map steps, but not at the reduce step.


%%time
chain.run(docs)

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/models/llms/examples/custom_llm.html,"How to write a custom LLM wrapper#
This notebook goes over how to create a custom LLM wrapper, in case you want to use your own LLM or a different wrapper than one that is supported in LangChain.
There is only one required thing that a custom LLM needs to implement:

A _call method that takes in a string, some optional stop words, and returns a string

There is a second optional thing it can implement:

An _identifying_params property that is used to help with printing of this class. Should return a dictionary.

Let’s implement a very simple custom LLM that just returns the first N characters of the input.


from typing import Any, List, Mapping, Optional

from langchain.callbacks.manager import CallbackManagerForLLMRun
from langchain.llms.base import LLM













class CustomLLM(LLM):

n: int

@property
def _llm_type(self) -> str:
return ""custom""

def _call(
self,
prompt: str,
stop: Optional[List[str]] = None,
run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForLLMRun] = None,
) -> str:
if stop is not None:
raise ValueError(""stop kwargs are not permitted."")
return prompt[:self.n]

@property
def _identifying_params(self) -> Mapping[str, Any]:
""""""Get the identifying parameters.""""""
return {""n"": self.n}











We can now use this as an any other LLM.


llm = CustomLLM(n=10)













llm(""This is a foobar thing"")











'This is a '











We can also print the LLM and see its custom print.


print(llm)

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/models/llms/examples/async_llm.html,"How to use the async API for LLMs#
LangChain provides async support for LLMs by leveraging the asyncio library.
Async support is particularly useful for calling multiple LLMs concurrently, as these calls are network-bound. Currently, OpenAI, PromptLayerOpenAI, ChatOpenAI and Anthropic are supported, but async support for other LLMs is on the roadmap.
You can use the agenerate method to call an OpenAI LLM asynchronously.

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9)
for _ in range(10):

This notebook goes over how to use the LLM class in LangChain.
The LLM class is a class designed for interfacing with LLMs. There are lots of LLM providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc) - this class is designed to provide a standard interface for all of them. In this part of the documentation, we will focus on generic LLM functionality. For details on working with a specific LLM wrapper, please see the examples in the How-To section.
For this notebook, we will work with an OpenAI LLM wrapper, although the functionalities highlighted are generic for all LLM types.


from langchain.llms import OpenAI













llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-ada-001"", n=2, best_of=2)











Generate Text: The most basic functionality an LLM has is just the ability to call it, passing in a string and getting back a string.


llm(""Tell me a joke"")











'\n\nWhy did the chicken cross the road?\n\nTo get to the other side.'











Generate: More broadly, you can call it with a list of inputs, getting back a more complete response than just the text. This complete response includes things like multiple top responses, as well as LLM provider specific information


llm_result = llm.generate([""Tell me a joke"", ""Tell me a poem""]*15)













len(llm_result.generations)











30













llm_result.generations[0]











[Generation(text='\n\nWhy did the chicken cross the road?\n\nTo get to the other side!'),
 Generation(text='\n\nWhy did the chicken cross the road?\n\nTo get to the other side.')]













llm_result.generations[-1]











[Generation(text=""\n\nWhat if love neverspeech\n\nWhat if love never ended\n\nWhat if love was only a feeling\n\nI'll never know this love\n\nIt's not a feeling\n\nBut it's what we have for each other\n\nWe just know that love is something strong\n\nAnd we can't help but be happy\n\nWe just feel what love is for us\n\nAnd we love each other with all our heart\n\nWe just don't know how\n\nHow it will go\n\nBut we know that love is something strong\n\nAnd we'll always have each other\n\nIn our lives.""),
 Generation(text='\n\nOnce upon a time\n\nThere was a love so pure and true\n\nIt lasted for centuries\n\nAnd never became stale or dry\n\nIt was moving and alive\n\nAnd the heart of the love-ick\n\nIs still beating strong and true.')]











You can also access provider specific information that is returned. This information is NOT standardized across providers.


llm_result.llm_output











{'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 3903,
'total_tokens': 4023,
'prompt_tokens': 120}}











Number of Tokens: You can also estimate how many tokens a piece of text will be in that model. This is useful because models have a context length (and cost more for more tokens), which means you need to be aware of how long the text you are passing in is.
Notice that by default the tokens are estimated using tiktoken (except for legacy version <3.8, where a Hugging Face tokenizer is used)


llm.get_num_tokens(""what a joke"")

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a core component of LangChain.
LangChain is not a provider of LLMs, but rather provides a standard interface through which
you can interact with a variety of LLMs.
The following sections of documentation are provided:

Getting Started: An overview of all the functionality the LangChain LLM class provides.
How-To Guides: A collection of how-to guides. These highlight how to accomplish various objectives with our LLM class (streaming, async, etc).

,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/models/getting_started.html,"Getting Started#
One of the core value props of LangChain is that it provides a standard interface to models. This allows you to swap easily between models. At a high level, there are two main types of models:

Language Models: good for text generation
Text Embedding Models: good for turning text into a numerical representation


Language Models#
There are two different sub-types of Language Models:

LLMs: these wrap APIs which take text in and return text
ChatModels: these wrap models which take chat messages in and return a chat message

This is a subtle difference, but a value prop of LangChain is that we provide a unified interface accross these. This is nice because although the underlying APIs are actually quite different, you often want to use them interchangeably.
To see this, let’s look at OpenAI (a wrapper around OpenAI’s LLM) vs ChatOpenAI (a wrapper around OpenAI’s ChatModel).


from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI













llm = OpenAI()













chat_model = ChatOpenAI()












text -> text interface#


llm.predict(""say hi!"")











'\n\nHi there!'













chat_model.predict(""say hi!"")











'Hello there!'













messages -> message interface#


from langchain.schema import HumanMessage













llm.predict_messages([HumanMessage(content=""say hi!"")])











AIMessage(content='\n\nHello! Nice to meet you!', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)













chat_model.predict_messages([HumanMessage(content=""say hi!"")])

These are concepts and terminology commonly used when developing LLM applications.
It contains reference to external papers or sources where the concept was first introduced,
as well as to places in LangChain where the concept is used.

Chain of Thought#
Chain of Thought (CoT) is a prompting technique used to encourage the model to generate a series of intermediate reasoning steps.
A less formal way to induce this behavior is to include “Let’s think step-by-step” in the prompt.

Chain-of-Thought Paper

Action Plan Generation#
Action Plan Generation is a prompting technique that uses a language model to generate actions to take.
The results of these actions can then be fed back into the language model to generate a subsequent action.

SayCan Paper



ReAct#
ReAct is a prompting technique that combines Chain-of-Thought prompting with action plan generation.
This induces the model to think about what action to take, then take it.

Paper
LangChain Example



Self-ask#
Self-ask is a prompting method that builds on top of chain-of-thought prompting.
In this method, the model explicitly asks itself follow-up questions, which are then answered by an external search engine.

Paper
LangChain Example



Prompt Chaining#
Prompt Chaining is combining multiple LLM calls, with the output of one-step being the input to the next.

PromptChainer Paper
Language Model Cascades
ICE Primer Book
Socratic Models



Memetic Proxy#
Memetic Proxy is encouraging the LLM
to respond in a certain way framing the discussion in a context that the model knows of and that
will result in that type of response.
For example, as a conversation between a student and a teacher.

Paper



Self Consistency#
Self Consistency is a decoding strategy that samples a diverse set of reasoning paths and then selects the most consistent answer.
Is most effective when combined with Chain-of-thought prompting.

Paper



Inception#
Inception is also called First Person Instruction.
It is encouraging the model to think a certain way by including the start of the model’s response in the prompt.

Example



MemPrompt#
MemPrompt maintains a memory of errors and user feedback, and uses them to prevent repetition of mistakes.

Paper"
,https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/getting_started/getting_started.html,"Quickstart Guide#
This tutorial gives you a quick walkthrough about building an end-to-end language model application with LangChain.

Installation#
To get started, install LangChain with the following command:
pip install langchain
# or
conda install langchain -c conda-forge











Environment Setup#
Using LangChain will usually require integrations with one or more model providers, data stores, apis, etc.
For this example, we will be using OpenAI’s APIs, so we will first need to install their SDK:
pip install openai









We will then need to set the environment variable in the terminal.
export OPENAI_API_KEY=""...""









Alternatively, you could do this from inside the Jupyter notebook (or Python script):
import os
os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = ""...""









If you want to set the API key dynamically, you can use the openai_api_key parameter when initiating OpenAI class—for instance, each user’s API key.
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
llm = OpenAI(openai_api_key=""OPENAI_API_KEY"")











Building a Language Model Application: LLMs#
Now that we have installed LangChain and set up our environment, we can start building our language model application.
LangChain provides many modules that can be used to build language model applications. Modules can be combined to create more complex applications, or be used individually for simple applications.


LLMs: Get predictions from a language model#
The most basic building block of LangChain is calling an LLM on some input.
Let’s walk through a simple example of how to do this.
For this purpose, let’s pretend we are building a service that generates a company name based on what the company makes.
In order to do this, we first need to import the LLM wrapper.
from langchain.llms import OpenAI









We can then initialize the wrapper with any arguments.
In this example, we probably want the outputs to be MORE random, so we’ll initialize it with a HIGH temperature.
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9)









We can now call it on some input!
text = ""What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?""
print(llm(text))









Feetful of Fun









For more details on how to use LLMs within LangChain, see the LLM getting started guide.


Prompt Templates: Manage prompts for LLMs#
Calling an LLM is a great first step, but it’s just the beginning.
Normally when you use an LLM in an application, you are not sending user input directly to the LLM.
Instead, you are probably taking user input and constructing a prompt, and then sending that to the LLM.
For example, in the previous example, the text we passed in was hardcoded to ask for a name for a company that made colorful socks.
In this imaginary service, what we would want to do is take only the user input describing what the company does, and then format the prompt with that information.
This is easy to do with LangChain!
First lets define the prompt template:
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

prompt = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=[""product""],
template=""What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?"",
)









Let’s now see how this works! We can call the .format method to format it.
print(prompt.format(product=""colorful socks""))









What is a good name for a company that makes colorful socks?









For more details, check out the getting started guide for prompts.


Chains: Combine LLMs and prompts in multi-step workflows#
Up until now, we’ve worked with the PromptTemplate and LLM primitives by themselves. But of course, a real application is not just one primitive, but rather a combination of them.
A chain in LangChain is made up of links, which can be either primitives like LLMs or other chains.
The most core type of chain is an LLMChain, which consists of a PromptTemplate and an LLM.
Extending the previous example, we can construct an LLMChain which takes user input, formats it with a PromptTemplate, and then passes the formatted response to an LLM.
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9)
prompt = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=[""product""],
template=""What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?"",
)









We can now create a very simple chain that will take user input, format the prompt with it, and then send it to the LLM:
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)









Now we can run that chain only specifying the product!
chain.run(""colorful socks"")
# -> '\n\nSocktastic!'









There we go! There’s the first chain - an LLM Chain.
This is one of the simpler types of chains, but understanding how it works will set you up well for working with more complex chains.
For more details, check out the getting started guide for chains.


Agents: Dynamically Call Chains Based on User Input#
So far the chains we’ve looked at run in a predetermined order.
Agents no longer do: they use an LLM to determine which actions to take and in what order. An action can either be using a tool and observing its output, or returning to the user.
When used correctly agents can be extremely powerful. In this tutorial, we show you how to easily use agents through the simplest, highest level API.
In order to load agents, you should understand the following concepts:

Tool: A function that performs a specific duty. This can be things like: Google Search, Database lookup, Python REPL, other chains. The interface for a tool is currently a function that is expected to have a string as an input, with a string as an output.
LLM: The language model powering the agent.
Agent: The agent to use. This should be a string that references a support agent class. Because this notebook focuses on the simplest, highest level API, this only covers using the standard supported agents. If you want to implement a custom agent, see the documentation for custom agents (coming soon).

Agents: For a list of supported agents and their specifications, see here.
Tools: For a list of predefined tools and their specifications, see here.
For this example, you will also need to install the SerpAPI Python package.
pip install google-search-results









And set the appropriate environment variables.
import os
os.environ[""SERPAPI_API_KEY""] = ""...""









Now we can get started!
from langchain.agents import load_tools
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
from langchain.agents import AgentType
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

# First, let's load the language model we're going to use to control the agent.
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)

# Next, let's load some tools to use. Note that the `llm-math` tool uses an LLM, so we need to pass that in.
tools = load_tools([""serpapi"", ""llm-math""], llm=llm)


# Finally, let's initialize an agent with the tools, the language model, and the type of agent we want to use.
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)

# Now let's test it out!
agent.run(""What was the high temperature in SF yesterday in Fahrenheit? What is that number raised to the .023 power?"")

Final Answer: The high temperature in SF yesterday in Fahrenheit raised to the .023 power is 1.0974509573251117.

> Finished chain.











Memory: Add State to Chains and Agents#
So far, all the chains and agents we’ve gone through have been stateless. But often, you may want a chain or agent to have some concept of “memory” so that it may remember information about its previous interactions. The clearest and simple example of this is when designing a chatbot - you want it to remember previous messages so it can use context from that to have a better conversation. This would be a type of “short-term memory”. On the more complex side, you could imagine a chain/agent remembering key pieces of information over time - this would be a form of “long-term memory”. For more concrete ideas on the latter, see this awesome paper.
LangChain provides several specially created chains just for this purpose. This notebook walks through using one of those chains (the ConversationChain) with two different types of memory.
By default, the ConversationChain has a simple type of memory that remembers all previous inputs/outputs and adds them to the context that is passed. Let’s take a look at using this chain (setting verbose=True so we can see the prompt).
from langchain import OpenAI, ConversationChain

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
conversation = ConversationChain(llm=llm, verbose=True)

output = conversation.predict(input=""Hi there!"")
print(output)









> Entering new chain...
Prompt after formatting:
The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

Current conversation:

Human: Hi there!
AI:

Prompt after formatting:
The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

Current conversation:

Human: Hi there!
AI:Hello! How are you today?
Human: I'm doing well! Just having a conversation with an AI.

Building a Language Model Application: Chat Models#
Similarly, you can use chat models instead of LLMs. Chat models are a variation on language models. While chat models use language models under the hood, the interface they expose is a bit different: rather than expose a “text in, text out” API, they expose an interface where “chat messages” are the inputs and outputs.
Chat model APIs are fairly new, so we are still figuring out the correct abstractions.


Get Message Completions from a Chat Model#
You can get chat completions by passing one or more messages to the chat model. The response will be a message. The types of messages currently supported in LangChain are AIMessage, HumanMessage, SystemMessage, and ChatMessage – ChatMessage takes in an arbitrary role parameter. Most of the time, you’ll just be dealing with HumanMessage, AIMessage, and SystemMessage.
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema import (
AIMessage,
HumanMessage,
SystemMessage
)

chat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)









You can get completions by passing in a single message.
chat([HumanMessage(content=""Translate this sentence from English to French. I love programming."")])
# -> AIMessage(content=""J'aime programmer."", additional_kwargs={})









You can also pass in multiple messages for OpenAI’s gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 models.
messages = [
SystemMessage(content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.""),
HumanMessage(content=""I love programming."")
]
chat(messages)
# -> AIMessage(content=""J'aime programmer."", additional_kwargs={})









You can go one step further and generate completions for multiple sets of messages using generate. This returns an LLMResult with an additional message parameter:
batch_messages = [
[
SystemMessage(content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.""),
HumanMessage(content=""I love programming."")
],
[
SystemMessage(content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.""),
HumanMessage(content=""I love artificial intelligence."")
],
]
result = chat.generate(batch_messages)
result
# -> LLMResult(generations=[[ChatGeneration(text=""J'aime programmer."", generation_info=None, message=AIMessage(content=""J'aime programmer."", additional_kwargs={}))], [ChatGeneration(text=""J'aime l'intelligence artificielle."", generation_info=None, message=AIMessage(content=""J'aime l'intelligence artificielle."", additional_kwargs={}))]], llm_output={'token_usage': {'prompt_tokens': 57, 'completion_tokens': 20, 'total_tokens': 77}})









You can recover things like token usage from this LLMResult:
result.llm_output['token_usage']
# -> {'prompt_tokens': 57, 'completion_tokens': 20, 'total_tokens': 77}











Chat Prompt Templates#
Similar to LLMs, you can make use of templating by using a MessagePromptTemplate. You can build a ChatPromptTemplate from one or more MessagePromptTemplates. You can use ChatPromptTemplate’s format_prompt – this returns a PromptValue, which you can convert to a string or Message object, depending on whether you want to use the formatted value as input to an llm or chat model.
For convenience, there is a from_template method exposed on the template. If you were to use this template, this is what it would look like:
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts.chat import (
ChatPromptTemplate,
SystemMessagePromptTemplate,
HumanMessagePromptTemplate,
)

chat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)

template = ""You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}.""
system_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(template)
human_template = ""{text}""
human_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template)

chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([system_message_prompt, human_message_prompt])

# get a chat completion from the formatted messages
chat(chat_prompt.format_prompt(input_language=""English"", output_language=""French"", text=""I love programming."").to_messages())
# -> AIMessage(content=""J'aime programmer."", additional_kwargs={})











Chains with Chat Models#
The LLMChain discussed in the above section can be used with chat models as well:
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain import LLMChain
from langchain.prompts.chat import (
ChatPromptTemplate,
SystemMessagePromptTemplate,
HumanMessagePromptTemplate,
)

chat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)

template = ""You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}.""
system_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(template)
human_template = ""{text}""
human_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template)
chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([system_message_prompt, human_message_prompt])

chain = LLMChain(llm=chat, prompt=chat_prompt)
chain.run(input_language=""English"", output_language=""French"", text=""I love programming."")
# -> ""J'aime programmer.""











Agents with Chat Models#
Agents can also be used with chat models, you can initialize one using AgentType.CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION as the agent type.
from langchain.agents import load_tools
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
from langchain.agents import AgentType
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

# First, let's load the language model we're going to use to control the agent.
chat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)

# Next, let's load some tools to use. Note that the `llm-math` tool uses an LLM, so we need to pass that in.
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
tools = load_tools([""serpapi"", ""llm-math""], llm=llm)


# Finally, let's initialize an agent with the tools, the language model, and the type of agent we want to use.
agent = initialize_agent(tools, chat, agent=AgentType.CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)

# Now let's test it out!
agent.run(""Who is Olivia Wilde's boyfriend? What is his current age raised to the 0.23 power?"")










> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
Thought: I need to use a search engine to find Olivia Wilde's boyfriend and a calculator to raise his age to the 0.23 power.
Action:
{
""action"": ""Search"",
""action_input"": ""Olivia Wilde boyfriend""
}

Observation: Sudeikis and Wilde's relationship ended in November 2020. Wilde was publicly served with court documents regarding child custody while she was presenting Don't Worry Darling at CinemaCon 2022. In January 2021, Wilde began dating singer Harry Styles after meeting during the filming of Don't Worry Darling.
Thought:I need to use a search engine to find Harry Styles' current age.
Action:
{
""action"": ""Search"",
""action_input"": ""Harry Styles age""
}

Observation: 29 years
Thought:Now I need to calculate 29 raised to the 0.23 power.
Action:
{
""action"": ""Calculator"",
""action_input"": ""29^0.23""
}

Observation: Answer: 2.169459462491557

Thought:I now know the final answer.
Final Answer: 2.169459462491557

Memory: Add State to Chains and Agents#
You can use Memory with chains and agents initialized with chat models. The main difference between this and Memory for LLMs is that rather than trying to condense all previous messages into a string, we can keep them as their own unique memory object.
from langchain.prompts import (
ChatPromptTemplate, 
MessagesPlaceholder, 
SystemMessagePromptTemplate, 
HumanMessagePromptTemplate
)
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.""),
MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""history""),
HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{input}"")
])

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True)
conversation = ConversationChain(memory=memory, prompt=prompt, llm=llm)

conversation.predict(input=""Hi there!"")
# -> 'Hello! How can I assist you today?'


conversation.predict(input=""I'm doing well! Just having a conversation with an AI."")
# -> ""That sounds like fun! I'm happy to chat with you. Is there anything specific you'd like to talk about?""

conversation.predict(input=""Tell me about yourself."")
# -> ""Sure! I am an AI language model created by OpenAI. I was trained on a large dataset of text from the internet, which allows me to understand and generate human-like language. I can answer questions, provide information, and even have conversations like this one. Is there anything else you'd like to know about me?""
